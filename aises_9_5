<h1 id="sec:corp-gov">Corporate Governance</h1>
<p><strong>Overview.</strong> AI companies need sound corporate
governance: it is essential that these firms are guided in directions
that enable the creation of safe and beneficial AIs. In this section, we
explain what corporate governance is, differentiating between
shareholder and stakeholder theory. Then, we give an overview of
different legal structures, ownership structures, organizational
structures, as well as internal and external assurance mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-corporate-governance">What Is Corporate Governance?</h2>
<p>There are different views on what the purpose of corporate governance
is. These differences are related to different theories about
capitalism.</p>
<p><strong>Shareholder theory.</strong> According to one view, corporate
governance is about the relationship between a company and its
<em>shareholders</em>. This view is based on <em>shareholder
theory</em>, according to which companies have an obligation to maximize
returns for their shareholders. Using this theory, the purpose of
corporate governance is to ensure that actors within a company act in
the best interest of the company’s shareholders. The relationship
between shareholders and actors within a company can be conceptualized
as the following problem: shareholders delegate responsibilities to
managers and workers, but managers and workers might not act in the
shareholders’ interests <span class="citation"
data-cites="jensen2019theory">[1]</span>. On this view, corporate
governance is ultimately a tool for maximizing shareholder value.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder theory.</strong> According to another view,
corporate governance is about the relationship between a company and its
<em>stakeholders</em>. The idea is that companies are responsible not
only to their shareholders but to many other stakeholders like
employees, business partners, and civil society <span class="citation"
data-cites="friedman2007social">[2]</span>. Following this theory, the
purpose of corporate governance is to balance the interests of
shareholders with the interests of other stakeholders. It refers to all
the rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and
controlled.<p>
For the purposes of this book, we consider corporate governance that
aims to achieve stakeholder representation, not shareholder
representation. We are mainly interested in how AI companies are or
should be governed to best advance the public interest <span
class="citation" data-cites="cihon2021corporate">[3]</span>. Next, we
will consider how a firm’s legal structure can help permit this.</p>
<h2 id="legal-structure">Legal Structure</h2>
<p>A company’s legal structure refers to its legal form and place of
incorporation, its statutes and bylaws.</p>
<p><strong>Legal form.</strong> AI companies can have different legal
forms. In the US, the most common form is a <em>C corporation</em> or
“C-corp” for short. Other forms include <em>public benefit corporations
(PBCs)</em>, <em>limited partnerships (LPs)</em>, and <em>limited
liability companies (LLCs)</em>. The choice of legal form has
significant influence on what a company is able and required to do. For
example, while C-corps must maximize shareholder value, PBCs can also
pursue public benefits. This can be important in situations where AI
companies may want to sacrifice profits in order to promote safety.
Google, Microsoft, and Meta are all C-corps, Anthropic is a PBC, and
OpenAI is an LP (which is partly owned by a nonprofit).</p>
<p><strong>Place of incorporation.</strong> Since there are significant
differences between jurisdictions, it matters where a company is
incorporated. An important distinction can be drawn between common law
countries like the US and UK, wherein judicial precedent is important,
and civil law countries like Germany and France, where recorded laws are
more comprehensive and less open to interpretation. But there are also
important differences within a given country. For example, in the US,
many AI companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic are incorporated in the
state of Delaware due to its relatively business-friendly regulations,
but they often have branches in other states like California.</p>
<p><strong>Statutes and bylaws.</strong> Although many governance
decisions are determined by the legal form and the place of
incorporation, companies have some room for customization. They can
customize their legal structure in their statutes and bylaws. Companies
are typically required to specify their mission statement in their
statutes. The mission of Google DeepMind is “to solve intelligence to
advance science and benefit humanity” and OpenAI’s mission is “to ensure
that AGI benefits all of humanity.” The statutes of PBCs also need to
contain a specific public benefits statement. But the statutes and
bylaws can also contain more specific rules; for example, an AI company
could give its board of directors specific powers, such as to veto the
deployment of a new model.<p>
Ensuring that a firm’s legal structures enable its employees to act in
the best interests of the firm’s stakeholders is important, and firms
have many ways to do this. Next, we will consider how ownership can help
solidify a firm’s safety-conscious goals.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-structure">Ownership Structure</h2>
<p>Companies are owned by shareholders, who elect the board of
directors, which appoints the senior executives who actually run the
company.</p>
<p><strong>Types of shareholders.</strong> AI companies can have
different types of shareholders. In their early stages, AI companies
typically get investments from wealthy individuals—so-called “angel
investors.” For example, Elon Musk was among the first investors in
OpenAI, while Dustin Moskovitz was part of the initial funding round of
Anthropic. As AI companies mature, professional investors like venture
capital (VC) firms and big tech companies start to invest—DeepMind was
acquired by Google in 2016, and Microsoft invested heavily in OpenAI. At
some point, many companies decide to “go public”, which means that they
are turned into publicly traded companies. At that point, institutional
investors like pension funds enter the stage. For example, Vanguard and
BlackRock are among the largest shareholders of Microsoft, Google, and
Meta, though the founders often retain a significant amount of shares.
It is also not uncommon to give early employees stock options, which
allow them to purchase stock at fixed prices.</p>
<p><strong>Powers of shareholders.</strong> Shareholders can influence
the company in several ways. They can voice concerns in the annual
general meeting and vote in shareholder resolutions. In the 2019 annual
general meeting of Alphabet, one shareholder called for better board
oversight of AI and suggested creating a Societal Risk Oversight
Committee. If the board of directors of a C-Corp does not act in the
shareholders’ interest, shareholders can theoretically replace them.
However, in practice this is very rare. A more common way to put
pressure on board members is to file lawsuits against them if they fail
to meet certain obligations. Such lawsuits are often settled in ways
that improve corporate governance. The attempt of shareholders to steer
the company in a certain direction is called <em>shareholder
activism</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Customized ownership structures.</strong> Depending on the
company’s legal form, it may be possible to customize the ownership
structure. A common way to do that is to issue two different classes of
shares: both classes give their holders ownership, but only one class
grants voting rights. This allows structures where the founders remain
in control of the company while other shareholders contribute capital
and receive returns on their investment. Another way to achieve certain
goals is to combine different legal entities. For example, the returns
of investors in the OpenAI LP are capped. Above a certain threshold,
returns are owned by the OpenAI nonprofit. They call this a
<em>capped-profit structure</em>. A related idea is to adopt a
governance structure that, under certain conditions, transfers control
to a committee representing society’s interests rather than the
shareholders’ interests.<p>
It is important who owns AI companies because these owners have strong
ways to influence operations. Next, we will put aside questions of
ownership and examine how these organizations are structured and
run.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-structure">Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>While shareholders own the company, it is governed by the board of
directors and managed by the chief executive officer (CEO) and other
senior executives.</p>
<p><strong>Board of directors.</strong> The board of directors is the
main governing body of the company. Board members have a legal
obligation to act in the best interests of the company, so-called
<em>fiduciary duties</em>. These duties can vary: board members of
Alphabet have the typical fiduciary duties of a C-Corp, while board
members of OpenAI’s nonprofit’s have a duty to “to ensure that AGI
benefits all of humanity,” not to maximize shareholder value. The board
has a number of powers they can use to steer the company in a more
prosocial direction. It sets the strategic priorities, is responsible
for risk oversight, and has significant influence over senior
management; for instance, it can replace the chief executive officer.
However, the board’s influence is often indirect. Many boards have
committees, some of which might be important from a safety perspective
such as a risk committee or audit committee.</p>
<p><strong>Senior executives.</strong> The company is managed by the
CEO, who appoints other senior executives such as a chief technology
officer (CTO), chief scientist, chief risk officer (CRO), and so on.
Since the behavior of executives is at least in part driven by financial
incentives, remuneration is often a valuable tool to ensure that they
act in the corporation’s interest. Before appointing new executives, the
board might also want to conduct background checks; in the case of AI
companies, a board might want to consider candidates’ views on risks
from AIs.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational units.</strong> Below the executive level, AI
companies have a number of teams, often in a hierarchical structure.
This will typically involve research and product development teams, but
also legal, risk management, finance, and many others. AI companies can
also have safety and governance teams. These teams should be well
resourced and have buy-in from senior management.<p>
In addition, some AI companies have other organizational structures,
such as an ethics board that advises the board of directors and senior
management, or an institutional review board (IRB) that checks if
publishing certain types of research might be harmful <span
class="citation" data-cites="cihon2021corporate">[3]</span>. Google
DeepMind has a IRB-like review committee that played a key role in the
release of AlphaFold.<p>
Various aspects of the legal, ownership, and organizational structure of
AI companies can influence to what extent their outputs focus on
employees’ and managers’ best interests, creating shareholder value, or
achieving their mission and ensuring societal wellbeing. In the last
subsection, we will explore how we can ensure that these structures are
well chosen and smoothly functioning.</p>
<h2 id="assurance">Assurance</h2>
<p>Different stakeholders within and outside AI companies need to know
whether existing governance structures are adequate. AI companies
therefore take a number of measures to evaluate and communicate the
adequacy of their governance structures. These measures are typically
referred to as <em>assurance</em>. We can distinguish between internal
and external assurance measures.</p>
<p><strong>Internal assurance.</strong> AI companies need to ensure that
senior executives and board members get the information they need to
make good decisions. It is, therefore, essential to define clear
reporting lines. To ensure that key decision-makers get objective
information, AI companies may set up an internal audit team that is
organizationally independent from senior management <span
class="citation" data-cites="schuett2023agi">[4]</span>. This team would
assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s risk management
practices, controls, and governance processes, and report directly to
the board of directors.</p>
<p><strong>External assurance.</strong> Many companies are legally
required to publicly report certain aspects of their governance
structures, such as whether the board of directors has an audit
committee. Often, AI companies also publish information about their
released models and often in the form of model or system cards. Some
organizations disclose parts of their safety strategy and their
governance practices as well; for instance, how they plan to ensure
their powerful AI systems are safe, whether they have an ethics board,
or how they conduct pre-deployment risk assessments. These publications
allow external actors like researchers and civil society organizations
to evaluate and scrutinize the company’s practices. In addition, many AI
companies commission independent experts to scrutinize their models,
typically in the form of third-party audits, red teaming exercises to
adversarially test systems, or bug bounty programs that reward finding
errors and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-corporate-governance">Conclusions About
Corporate Governance</h3>
<p>Corporate governance refers to all the rules, practices, and
processes by which a company is directed and controlled—–ranging from
its legal form and place of incorporation to its board committees and
remuneration policy. The purpose of corporate governance is to balance
the interests of a company’s shareholders with the interests of other
stakeholders, including society at large. To this end, AI companies are
advised to follow existing best practices in corporate governance.
However, in light of increasing societal risks from AI, they also need
to consider more innovative governance solutions, such as a
capped-profit structure or a long-term benefit committee.</p>
