<h1 id="preferences">6.5 Preferences</h1>
<strong>Should we have
AIs satisfy people’s preferences?</strong>
A preference is a tendency to favor one thing over another. Someone
might prefer chocolate ice cream over vanilla ice cream, or they might
prefer that one party wins the election rather than another. These
preferences will influence actions. If someone prefers chocolate ice
cream over vanilla, they’re more likely to choose the former. Similarly,
if someone prefers one political party over another, they will likely
vote accordingly. In this manner, our preferences shape our behavior,
guiding us toward certain choices and actions over others. Preference is
similar to desire but always comparative. Someone might desire something
in itself—a new book, a vacation, or a delicious meal—but a preference
always involves a comparison between two or more alternatives.</p>
<strong>Overview.</strong>
In this section, we will consider whether preferences may have an
important role to play in machine ethics. In particular, if we want to
design an advanced AI system, the preferences of the people affected by
its decisions should plausibly help guide its decision-making. In fact,
some people (such as preference utilitarians) would say that preferences
are all we need. However, even if we don’t take this view, we should
recognize that preferences are still important. Preferences are further
explored in the next two chapters. First, in the chapter on ethics, we
discussed the idea that wellbeing might consist in having one’s
preferences satisfied. Second, in the chapter on utility functions, we
explain how preferences can be used to construct a utility function that
assigns numerical values to options and outcomes.<p>
To use preferences as the basis for increasing social wellbeing, we must
somehow combine the conflicting preferences of different people. We’ll
come to this later in this chapter, in a section on social welfare
functions. Before that, however, we must answer a more basic question:
what exactly does it mean to say that someone prefers one thing over
another? Moreover, we must decide why we think that satisfying someone’s
preferences is good for them and whether all kinds of preferences are
equally valuable. This section considers three different types of
preferences that could all potentially play a role in decision-making by
AI systems: revealed preferences, stated preferences, and idealized
preferences.</p>
<h2 id="revealed-preferences">6.5.1 Revealed Preferences</h2>
<p><strong>Preferences can be inferred from behavior.</strong> One set
of techniques for getting AI systems to behave as we want—inverse
reinforcement learning—is to have them deduce <em>revealed
preferences</em> from our behavior. We say that someone has a revealed
preference for X over Y if they choose X when Y is also available. In
this way, preference is revealed through choice. Consider, for example,
someone deciding what to have for dinner at a restaurant. They’re given
a menu, a list of various dishes they could order. The selection they
make from the menu is seen as a demonstration of their preference. If
they choose a grilled chicken salad over a steak or a plate of
spaghetti, they’ve just revealed their preference for grilled chicken
salad, at least in that specific context and time.<p>
While all theories of preferences agree that there is an important link
between preference and choice, the revealed preference account goes one
step further and claims that preference simply <em>is</em> choice.</p>
<strong>Revealed preferences
preserve autonomy.</strong>
One advantage of revealed preferences is that we don’t have to guess
what someone prefers. We can simply look at what they choose. In this
way, revealed preferences can help us avoid paternalism. Paternalism is
when leaders use their sovereignty to make decisions for their subjects,
limiting their freedom or choices, believing it is for the subjects’ own
good. However, we may think that typically people are themselves the
best judges of what is good for them. If so, then by relying on people’s
actions to reveal their preferences, we avoid the risk of
paternalism.</p>
<strong>However,
there are problems with revealed preferences.</strong>
The next few subsections will explore the challenges of
misinformation, weakness of will, and manipulation in the context of
revealed preferences. We will discuss how misinformation can lead to
choices that do not accurately reflect a person’s true preferences, and
how weakness of will can cause individuals to act against their genuine
preferences. Additionally, we will examine the various ways in which
preferences can be manipulated, ranging from advertising tactics to
extreme cases like cults, and the ethical implications of preference
manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="misinformation">Misinformation</h3>
<strong>Revealed
preferences can sometimes be based on misinformation.</strong>
If someone buys a used car that turns out to be defective, it doesn’t
mean they preferred a faulty car. They intended to buy a reliable car,
but due to a lack of information or deceit from the seller, they ended
up with a substandard one. Similarly, losing at chess doesn’t indicate a
preference for losing; rather, it’s an outcome of facing a stronger
player or making mistakes during the game. This means that we cannot
always infer someone’s preferences from the choices they make. Choice
does not reveal a preference between things as they actually are, but
between things as the person understands them. Therefore, we can’t rely
on revealed preferences if they are based on misinformation.</p>
<h3 id="weakness-of-will">Weakness of Will</h3>
<p><strong>Choices can be due to a lack of willpower rather than
considered preferences.</strong> Consider a smoker who wants to quit.
Each time they light a cigarette, they may be acting against their
genuine preference to stop smoking, succumbing instead to the power of
addiction. Therefore, it would be erroneous to conclude from their
behavior that they think that continuing to smoke would be best for
their wellbeing.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation">Manipulation</h3>
<p><strong>Revealed preferences can be manipulated in various
ways.</strong> Manipulations like persuasive advertising might
manipulate people into buying products they don’t actually want.
Similarly, revealed preferences might be the result of social pressure
rather than considered judgment, such as when buying a particular style
of clothing. In such cases, the manipulation may not be especially
malicious. At the other extreme, however, cults may brainwash their
members into preferring things they would not otherwise want, even
committing suicide. In the context of decision-making by advanced AI
systems, manipulation is a serious risk. An AI advisor system could
attempt to influence our decision-making for a variety of
reasons—perhaps its designer wants to promote specific products—by
presenting options in some particular way; for instance, by presenting a
list of options that looks exhaustive and excluding something it doesn’t
want us to consider.</p>
<strong>If
preference satisfaction is important, perhaps manipulation is
acceptable.</strong>
In at least some of these cases, it seems clear that preference
manipulation is bad. However, it may be less clear exactly why it is
bad. A natural answer is to say that people might be manipulated into
preferring things that are bad for them. Someone who is manipulated by
advertising into preferring junk food might thereby suffer negative
health consequences. However, if we think that wellbeing simply consists
in preference satisfaction, it doesn’t make sense to say that we might
prefer what is bad for us. On this account, having one’s preferences
satisfied is by definition good, regardless of whether those preferences
have been manipulated. This might lead us to think that what matters is
not (or at least not only) preference satisfaction, but happiness or
enjoyment. We’ll discuss this in the section on happiness.</p>
<strong>Disliking
manipulation suggests that wellbeing requires autonomy.</strong>
On the other hand, some may find that manipulation is bad even if the
person is manipulated into doing something that is good for them. For
example, suppose a doctor lies to her patient, telling him that unless
he loses weight, he will likely die soon. As a result, the patient
becomes greatly motivated to lose weight and successfully does so. This
provides a range of health benefits, even if his doctor never had any
reason to believe he would have died otherwise. If we think manipulation
is still bad, lack of enjoyment can’t be the whole story. This suggests
that we object to manipulation in part because it violates autonomy. We
might then think that autonomy—the ability to decide important matters
for oneself, without coercion—is objectively valuable regardless of what
the agent prefers. We’ll discuss this in the section on objective
goods.</p>
<h3 id="inverse-reinforcement-learning">Inverse Reinforcement
Learning</h3>
<strong>Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) relies on revealed preferences.</strong>
IRL is a powerful technique in the field of machine learning, which
focuses on extracting an agent’s objectives or preferences by observing
its behaviors. In more technical terms, IRL is about reverse engineering
the reward function—an internal ranking system that an agent uses to
assess the value of different outcomes—that the agent appears to be
optimizing, given a set of its actions and a model of the environment.
This technique can help ensure the alignment of AI system’s behaviors
with human values and preferences. However, leveraging revealed
preferences or observable choices of humans to train AI systems using
IRL poses significant challenges pertaining to AI safety.</p>
<strong>Using
revealed preferences as a training mechanism for IRL can be risky.</strong>
Reconsider the chess example: losing a game does not mean that we
prefer to lose. This interpretation could be a misrepresentation of the
player’s true preferences, potentially leading to undesirable outcomes.
Furthermore, extending observed preferences to unfamiliar situations
poses another hurdle. I may prefer to eat ice cream for dessert, but
that doesn’t mean I prefer to eat it for every meal. Similarly, I may
prefer to wear comfortable shoes for hiking, but that doesn’t mean I
want to wear them to a formal event. An AI system could inaccurately
extrapolate preferences from limited or context-specific data and
misapply these to other scenarios. Therefore, while revealed preferences
can offer significant insights for training AI, it is vital to
understand their limitations to safeguard the safety and efficiency of
AI systems.</p>
<strong>Summary.</strong>
Revealed preferences can be a powerful tool, as they allow an
individual’s actions to speak for themselves, reducing the risk of
paternalistic intervention. However, revealed preferences have inherent
shortcomings such as susceptibility to misinformation and manipulation,
which can mislead an AI system. This emphasizes the caution needed in
relying solely on revealed preferences for AI training. It underscores
the importance of supplementing revealed preferences with other methods
to ensure a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of a user’s
true preferences.</p>
<h2 id="stated-preferences">6.5.2 Stated Preferences</h2>
<p><strong>Preferences can be straightforwardly queried.</strong>
Another set of techniques for getting AI systems to behave as we
want—human supervision and feedback—rely on people to state their
preferences. A person’s <strong>stated preferences</strong> are the
preferences they would report if asked. For example, someone might ask a
friend which movie they want to see. Similarly, opinion polls might ask
people which party they would vote for. In both cases, we rely on what
people say as opposed to what they do, as was the case with revealed
preferences.<p>
Stated preferences overcome some of the difficulties with revealed
preferences. For example, stated preferences are less likely to be
subject to weakness of will: when we are further removed from the
situation, we are less inclined to fall for temptations. Therefore,
stated preferences are more likely to reflect our stable, long-term
interests.</p>
<strong>Stated preferences are
still imperfect.</strong>
Stated preferences do not overcome all difficulties with revealed
preferences. Stated preferences can still be manipulated. Further,
individuals might state preferences they believe to be socially
acceptable or admirable rather than what they truly prefer, particularly
when the topics are sensitive or controversial. Someone might overstate
their commitment to recycling in a survey, for instance, due to societal
pressure and norms around environmental responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="preference-accounting">Preference Accounting</h3>
<p>One set of problems with stated preferences concern which types of
preferences should be satisfied.</p>
<strong>First,
someone might never know their preference was fulfilled.</strong>
Suppose someone is on a trip far away. On a bus journey, they
exchange a few glances with a stranger whom they’ll never meet again.
Nevertheless they form the preference that the stranger’s life goes
well. Should this preference be taken into account? By assumption, they
will never be in a position to know whether the preference has been
satisfied or not. Therefore, they will never experience any of the
enjoyment associated with having their preference satisfied.</p>
<strong>Second,
we may or may not care about the preferences of the dead.</strong>
Suppose someone in the 18th century wanted to be famous long after
their death. Should such preferences count? Do they give us reason to
promote that person’s fame today? As in the previous example, the
satisfaction of such preferences can’t contribute any enjoyment to the
person’s life. Could it be that what we really care about is enjoyment
or happiness, and that preferences are a useful but imperfect guide
toward what we enjoy? We will return to this in the section on
happiness.</p>
<strong>Third,
preferences can be about others’ preferences being fulfilled.</strong>Suppose a parent prefers that their children’s preferences are
satisfied. Should this preference count, in addition to their children’s
preferences themselves? If we say yes, it follows that it is more
important to satisfy the preferences of those who have many people who
care for them than of those who do not. One might think that this is a
form of double counting, and claim that it is unfair to those with fewer
who care for them. On the other hand, one might take fairness to mean
that we should treat everyone’s preferences equally—including their
preferences about other people’s preferences.</p>
<strong>Fourth, preferences might
be harmful.</strong>
Suppose someone hates their neighbor, and prefers that they meet a
cruel fate. We might think that such malicious or harmful preferences
should not be included. On this view, we should only give weight to
preferences that are in some sense morally acceptable. However,
specifying exactly which preferences should be excluded may be
difficult. There are many cases where satisfying one person’s
preferences may negatively impact others. For example, whenever some
good is scarce, giving more of it to one person necessarily implies that
someone else will get less. Therefore, some more detailed account of
which preferences should be excluded is needed.</p>
<strong>Fifth, we
might be confused about our preferences.</strong>
Suppose a mobile app asks its users to choose between two privacy
settings upon installation: allowing the app to access their location
data all the time, or allowing the app to access their location data
only while they’re using the app. While these options seem
straightforward, the implications of this choice are much more complex.
To make a truly informed decision, users need to understand how location
data is used, how it can be combined with other data for targeted
advertising or profiling, what the privacy risks of data breaches are,
and how the app’s use of data aligns with local data protection laws.
However, we may not fully understand the alternatives we’re choosing
between.</p>
<strong>Sixth,
preferences can be inconsistent over time.</strong>
It could be that the choice we make will change us in some
fundamental way. When we undergo such transformative experiences <span
class="citation" data-cites="paul2014transformative">[1]</span>, our
preferences might change. Some claim that becoming a parent,
experiencing severe disability, or undergoing a religious conversion can
be like this. If this is right, how should we evaluate someone’s
preference between becoming a parent and not becoming a parent? Should
we focus on their current preferences, prior to making the choice, or on
the preferences they will develop after making the choice? In many cases
we may not even know what those new preferences will be.<p>
As technology advances, we may increasingly have the option to bring
about transformative experiences <span class="citation"
data-cites="paul2014transformative">[1]</span>. For this reason, it is
important that advanced AI systems tasked with decision-making are able
to reason appropriately about transformative experiences. For this, we
cannot rely on people’s stated preferences alone. By definition, stated
preferences can only reflect the person’s identity at the time. Of
course, people can try to take possible future developments into account
when they state their preferences. However, if they undergo a
transformative experience their preferences might change in ways they
cannot anticipate.</p>
<h3 id="human-supervision">Human Supervision</h3>
<p><strong>Stated preferences are used to train some AI
systems.</strong> In reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF),
standard reinforcement learning is augmented by human feedback from
people who rank the outputs of the system. In RLHF, humans evaluate and
rank the outputs of the system based on quality, usefulness, or another
defined criterion, providing valuable data to guide the system’s
iterative learning process. This ranking serves as a form of reward
function that the system uses to adjust its behavior and improve future
outputs.<p>
Imagine that we are teaching a robot how to make a cup of coffee. In the
RLHF process, the AI would attempt to output a cup of coffee, and then
we would provide feedback on how well it did. We could rank different
attempts and the robot would use this information to understand how to
make better coffee in the future. The feedback helps the robot learn not
just from its own trial and error, but also from our expertise and
judgment. However, this approach has some known difficulties.</p>
<strong>First,
as AI systems become more powerful, human feedback might be
infeasible.</strong>
As the problems AI solve become increasingly difficult, using human
supervision and feedback to ensure that those systems behave as desired
becomes difficult as well. In complex tasks like creating bug-free and
secure code, generating arguments that are not only persuasive but true,
or forecasting long-term implications of policy decisions, it may be too
time-consuming or even impossible for humans to evaluate and guide AI
behavior. Moreover, there are inherent risks from depending on human
reliability: human feedback may be systematically biased in various
ways. For example, inconvenient but true things may often be labeled as
bad. In addition to any bias, relying on human feedback will inevitably
mean some rate of human error.</p>
<strong>Second, RLHF
usually does not account for ethics.</strong>
Approaches based on human supervision and feedback are very broad.
These approaches primarily focus on task-specific performance, such as
generating accurate book summaries or bug-free code. However, these
task-specific evaluations may not necessarily translate into a
comprehensive understanding of ethical principles or human values.
Rather, they improve general capabilities since humans prefer smarter
models.<p>
Take, for instance, feedback on code generation. A human supervisor
might provide feedback based on the code’s functionality, efficiency, or
adherence to best programming practices. While this feedback helps in
creating better code, it doesn’t necessarily guide the AI system in
understanding broader ethical considerations, such as ensuring privacy
protection or maintaining fairness in algorithmic decisions.
Specifically, while RLHF is effective for improving AI performance in
specific tasks, it does not inherently equip AI systems with what’s
needed to grapple with moral questions. This gap underscores the need
for specific machine ethics research.</p>
<strong>Summary.</strong>
We’ve seen that stated preferences have certain advantages over
revealed preferences. However, stated preferences still have issues of
their own. It may not be clear how we should account for all different
kinds of preferences, such as ones that are only satisfied after the
person has died, or ones that fundamentally alter who we are. For these
reasons, we should be wary of using stated preferences alone to train
AI.</p>
<h2 id="idealized-preferences">6.5.3 Idealized Preferences</h2>
<p><strong>We could idealize preferences to avoid problems like weakness
of will.</strong> A third approach to getting AI systems to behave as we
want is to make them able to infer what we would prefer if our
preferences weren’t subject to the various distorting forces we’ve come
across. Someone’s <strong>idealized preferences</strong> are the
preferences they would have if they were suitably informed. Idealized
preferences avoid many of the problems of both revealed preferences and
stated preferences. Idealized preferences would not be based on false
beliefs, nor would they be subject to weakness of will, manipulation, or
framing effects. This makes it clearer how idealized preferences might
be linked to wellbeing, and therefore something we might ask an AI
system to implement.</p>
<strong>It is unclear how we
idealize preferences.</strong>
What exactly do we need to do to figure out what someone’s idealized
preferences are, based on their revealed preferences or their stated
preferences? It’s clear that the idealized preferences should not be
based on any false beliefs. We might imagine a person’s idealized
preferences as ones they would have if they fully grasped the options
they faced and were able to think through the situation in great detail.
However, this description is rather vague. It may be that it doesn’t
uniquely narrow down a set of idealized preferences. That is, there may
be multiple different ways of idealizing someone’s preferences, each of
which is one possible way that the idealized deliberation could go. If
so, idealized preferences may not help us decide what to do in such
cases.<p>
Additionally, some may argue that in addition to removing any dependence
on false belief or other misapprehensions, idealized preferences should
also take moral considerations into account. For example, perhaps
malicious preferences of the kind discussed earlier would not remain
after idealization. These may not be insurmountable problems for the
view that advanced AI systems should be tasked with satisfying people’s
idealized preferences. However, it shows that the view stands in need of
further elaboration, and that different people may disagree over what
exactly should go into the idealization procedure.</p>
<strong>We might think
that preferences are pointless.</strong>
Suppose someone’s only preference, even after idealization, is to
count the blades of grass on some lawn. This preference may strike us as
valueless, even if we suppose that the person in question derives great
enjoyment from the satisfaction of their preferences. It is unclear
whether such preferences should be taken into account. The example may
seem far-fetched, but it raises the question of whether preferences need
to meet some additional criteria in order to carry weight. Perhaps
preferences, at least in part, must be aimed at some worthy goal in
order to count. If so, we might be drawn toward an objective goods view
of wellbeing, according to which achievements are important objective
goods.<p>
On the other hand, we may think that judging certain preferences as
lacking value reveals an objectionable form of elitism. It is unfair to
impose our own judgments of what is valuable on other people using
hypothetical thought experiments, especially when we know their actual
preferences. Perhaps we should simply let people pursue their own
conception of what is valuable.</p>
<strong>We might
disagree with our idealized preferences.</strong>
Suppose someone mainly listens to country music, but it turns out
that their idealized preference is to listen to opera. When they
themselves actually listen to opera music, they have a miserable
experience. It seems unlikely that we should insist that listening to
opera is, in fact, good for them despite the absence of any enjoyment.
This gives rise to an elitism objection like before. If they don’t enjoy
satisfying their idealized preferences, why should those preferences be
imposed on them? This might lead us to think that what ultimately
matters is enjoyment or happiness, rather than preference satisfaction.
Alternatively, it might lead us to conclude that autonomy matters in
addition to preference satisfaction. If idealized preferences are
imposed on someone who would in fact rather choose contrary to those
idealized preferences, this would violate their autonomy.<p>
One might think that with the correct idealization procedure, this could
never happen. That is, whatever the idealization procedure does––remove
false beliefs and other misconceptions, increase awareness and
understanding––it should never result in anything so alien that the
actual person would not enjoy it. On the other hand, it’s difficult to
know exactly how much our preferences would change when idealized.
Perhaps removing false beliefs and acquiring detailed understanding of
the options would be a transformative experience that fundamentally
alters our preferences. If so, idealized preferences may well be so
alien from the person’s actual preferences that they would not enjoy
having them satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="ai-ideal-advisor">AI Ideal Advisor</h3>
<strong>One
potential application of idealized preferences is the AI ideal
advisor.</strong>
Suppose someone who hates exploitation and takes serious
inconvenience to avoid emissions would ideally want to buy food that has
been ethically produced, but does not realize that some of their
groceries are unethically produced. An AI ideal advisor would be
equipped with detailed real-world knowledge, such as the details of
supply chains, that could help them make this decision. In addition to
providing factual information, the AI ideal advisor would be
disinterested: it wouldn’t favor any specific entity, object, or course
of action solely due to their particular qualities (such as nationality
or brand), unless explicitly directed to do so. It would also be
dispassionate, meaning that it wouldn’t let its advice be swayed by
emotion. Finally, it would be consistent, applying the same set of moral
principles across all situations <span class="citation"
data-cites="giubilini2018artificial">[2]</span>.<p>
Such an AI ideal advisor could possibly help us better satisfy the moral
preferences we already have. Something close to the AI ideal advisor has
previously been discussed in the context of AI safety under the names of
“coherent extrapolated volition” and “indirect normativity.” In all
cases, the fundamental idea is to take an agent’s actual preferences,
idealize them in certain ways, and then use the result to guide
decision-making by advanced AI systems. Of course, having such an
advisor requires that we solve many of the challenges that we presented
in the Single Agent Safety chapter, as well as settle on a clear way to identify and idealize
individual preferences.</p>
<strong>Summary.</strong>
Idealized preferences overcome many of the difficulties of revealed
and stated preferences. Because idealized preferences are free from the
misconceptions that may affect these other types of preferences, they
are more plausibly ones that we would want an AI system to satisfy.
However, figuring out what people’s preferences would in fact be after
idealization can be difficult. Moreover, it could be that the
preferences are without value even after idealization, or that the
actual person would not appreciate having their idealized preferences
satisfied. An AI ideal advisor might be difficult to create, but sounds
highly appealing.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-preferences">Conclusions About
Preferences</h3>
<p><strong>Preferences seem relevant to wellbeing—but we don’t know
which ones.</strong> The preferences people reveal through choice often
provide evidence about what is good for them, but they can be distorted
by misinformation, manipulation, and other factors. In some cases,
people’s stated preferences may be a better guide to what is good for
them, though it is not always clear how to account for stated
preferences. If we are looking for a notion of preference that plausibly
captures what is good for someone, idealized preferences are a better
bet. However, it can be difficult to figure out what someone’s idealized
preferences would be. It seems, then, that preferences-—while important
to wellbeing and useful to train AI in accordance with human values—are
not a sufficient basis for a comprehensive account of machine
ethics.</p>
<strong>Moving from preferences
to happiness.</strong>
People’s preferences can be easily influenced by external factors.
For instance, individuals may be swayed by persuasive advertising and
purchase products that do not truly fulfill their needs or bring them
lasting happiness. Similarly, social media platforms often present an
idealized version of other people’s lives, leading many to compare
themselves to others and feel inadequate or unhappy with their own
circumstances. Inconsistent preferences pose a challenge for the
preference satisfaction view, as discussed in the previous
section.<p>
One way of ensuring people’s preferences reflect their wellbeing is to
use idealized preferences. The preferences that people would have if
they were suitably informed and rational would be well-defined and
aligned with their interests. However, as we explored in the previous
section, this view faces another problem: if satisfying someone’s
idealized preferences does not bring them any pleasure or enjoyment, why
should it matter that they are satisfied?<p>
This objection suggests that what we ultimately care about is happiness
rather than preference satisfaction. If so, we should use a framework
that places happiness front and center. By instructing an AI system to
increase happiness, we might aim to overcome the human biases and
limitations that stop us from pursuing our happiness and enable the
system to make decisions that have a positive impact on overall
wellbeing.</p>
