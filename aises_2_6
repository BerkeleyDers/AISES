<p>Understanding the technical underpinnings of AI systems—the
underlying models and algorithms, how they work, how they are used, and
how they are evaluated—is essential to understanding the safety, ethics,
and societal impact of these technologies. This foundation equips us
with the necessary grounding and context to identify and critically
analyze their capabilities and potential, as well as the risks that they
pose. It allows us to discern potential pitfalls in their design,
implementation, and deployment and devise strategies to ensure their
safe, ethical, and beneficial use.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we presented the fundamentals of artificial
intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), which aims to
create systems that can learn without being explicitly instructed. We
examined its foundational principles, methodologies, and evolution,
detailing key techniques, concepts, and practical applications.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence.</strong> We first discussed AI, the
vast umbrella that encapsulates the idea of machines performing tasks
typically associated with human intelligence. AI and its conceptual
origins date back to the 1940s and 1950s when the project of creating
“intelligent machines” came to the fore. The field experienced periods
of flux over the following decades, waxing and waning until the modern
deep learning era was ushered in by the groundbreaking release of
AlexNet in 2012, driven by increased data availability and advances in
hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Defining AI.</strong> The term “artificial intelligence” has
many meanings, and the capabilities of AI systems exist on a continuum.
Five widely used conceptual categories to distinguish between different
types of AI are narrow AI, artificial general intelligence (AGI),
human-level AI (HLAI), transformative AI (TAI), and artificial
superintelligence (ASI). While these concepts provide a basis for
thinking about the intelligence and generality of AI systems, they are
not well-defined or complete, often overlapping and used in different,
conflicting ways. Therefore, in evaluating risk, it is essential to
consider AI systems based on their specific capabilities instead of
broad categorizations.</p>
<p><strong>The ML process.</strong> We presented a general framework for
understanding ML models by considering five aspects of a model: its
task, input data, output, and what type of machine learning it uses. We
then discussed each of these aspects in turn. We explored common tasks
for ML models, including classification, regression, anomaly detection,
and sequence modeling. We highlighted a few of the many types of data
that these models work with and discussed the model development process.
Creating an ML model is a multi-step process that typically includes
data collection, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
Measuring the performance of a model in evaluation is a critical step in
the development process. We surveyed several metrics used to achieve
this, as well as the broader, often conflicting goals that guide this
process.</p>
<p><strong>Types of ML.</strong> We discussed different approaches to
machine learning and how these categories are neither well-defined nor
complete, even though distinctions are often drawn between different
“types” of machine learning. We surveyed four common approaches to ML:
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
deep learning. At a high level, supervised learning is learning from
labeled data, unsupervised learning is learning from unlabeled data, and
reinforcement learning is learning from agent-gathered data. Deep
learning techniques are used in all three settings, leveraging deep
neural networks to achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning.</strong> We then examined deep learning in
more depth. We saw how, beyond its use of multi-layer neural networks,
deep learning is characterized by its ability to learn hierarchical
representations that provide deep learning models with great flexibility
and power. Machine learning models are functions that capture
relationships between inputs and outputs with representations that allow
them to capture an especially broad family of relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Components of DL models.</strong> We explored the essential
components of deep learning models and neural networks. Through the
example of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), we broke down neural
networks, structures composed of layers of neurons, into an input layer,
an output layer, one or more hidden layers, weights, biases, and
activation functions. We highlighted a few significant activation
functions and examined other fundamental building blocks of deep
learning models, including residual connections, convolution, and
self-attention. We also presented influential architectures, such as
CNNs and Transformers.</p>
<p><strong>Processes in DL models.</strong> We discussed how deep
learning models learn and are used in training and inference. We walked
through the steps to training a deep learning model, beginning with
initialization and then cycling through sending information forward to
make a prediction, measuring its error or quality, sending this error
backward, and adjusting parameters accordingly until a stopping
criterion is reached. We discussed training techniques such as
pre-training, fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot learning,
and how training typically involves a combination of many methods and
techniques used in conjunction. We considered the importance of
scalability, computational efficiency, and interpretability in
evaluating deep learning models and their suitability for deployment. We
plotted the course of technical and architectural development in the
field, from LeNet in 1989 to BERT and GPT models in 2018. We considered
real-world applications of deep learning in communication and
entertainment, transportation and logistics, and healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling laws.</strong> Scaling laws describe mathematical
relationships between model performance and key factors like model size
and dataset size in deep learning. These power law equations show that
as models grow in parameters and are trained on more data, their loss
tends to decrease substantially, though not linearly. Scaling up
computational resources used to train a model can enable an increase in
both model parameters and the amount of data used in training.
Researchers can leverage scaling laws to determine optimal model and
dataset sizes given computational constraints. for example, the
Chinchilla model from Google DeepMind demonstrates that smaller models
can outperform larger ones if given much more training data. Scaling
laws hold across many modalities and orders of magnitude. However, these
laws only appear to apply to certain types of model such as generative
models.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning.</strong> Finally, we turned our
attention to reinforcement learning and explored the field’s basic
concepts, terminology, and techniques. We examined RL problems, which
provide the general framework through which reinforcement learning
attempts to automate the capacity of an agent to learn from its actions
and their consequences in an environment. In these problems, agents
learn to make decisions through trial and error. Through the toy
examples of multi-armed bandits and Gridworld, we introduced the major
concepts and terms used in reinforcement learning. Lastly, we saw a few
examples of groundbreaking applications of RL in gaming, including
AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and Cicero.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>AI created fundamental changes, offering benefits and
presenting risks.</strong> AI is increasingly being integrated into
business, education, healthcare, communication, and other aspects of our
lives. As its influence grows, so too does its potential for harm. AI
systems and their use, whether to automate intricate processes in
manufacturing or to personalize experiences in retail and entertainment,
have direct, real-world impacts. Moreover, AI introduces unique risks,
as it involves the creation of systems that have the ability to learn
and pursue objectives. While highly advanced or general AI systems often
garner the most attention, AI can pose risks at any level of capability.
Even a narrowly-designed model in a critical infrastructure system could
cause significant damage or disruption if it malfunctions or is
exploited. Therefore, it is essential to consider the risks and impact
of AI across multiple scales: immediate <em>and</em> long-term,
individual <em>and</em> societal.</p>
<p><strong>Predicting the trajectory and impact of AI is a difficult and
uncertain task.</strong> We have already seen AI systems that achieved
better-than-human performance in specific, narrow tasks such as image
recognition or playing chess. As technological advancement continues, it
is possible that we may see more general, advanced, and transformative
systems that can perform a wider array of tasks and adapt to more
complex scenarios. However, forecasting these developments involves a
high degree of uncertainty, both in terms of rate and direction of AI
advancement and in the potential risks and capabilities of individual
systems. The progression of AI is not linear and is influenced by a
multitude of factors, including advancements in algorithms, hardware,
data availability, policy regulations, and economic conditions. Hence, a
prudent approach to AI development involves continuous vigilance,
rigorous testing, and adaptable strategies to manage both expected and
unanticipated challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning has emerged as a potent and defining force in
AI, driving significant advancements and innovations.</strong> The
strength of deep learning models lies in their ability to learn and
generalize from extensive datasets. Deep learning models can process
massive quantities of information, discerning patterns and relationships
that are too complex for traditional algorithms. These powerful
capabilities are integral to many tools and systems we encounter in our
daily lives. Deep learning is the engine behind systems that recognize
patterns in images and speech, enabling technologies like automatic
photo tagging and voice-activated virtual assistants. It powers
autonomous vehicles, chatbots, predictive modeling tools, and
translation applications. The scope of deep learning’s influence is vast
and continues to expand, underscoring its pivotal role in the future of
AI.<br />
Despite their accomplishments, DL and ML systems have many flaws and
limitations. Their performance and capabilities depend on a number of
factors, including the quality and quantity of training data, the
algorithms and architectures used, and the amount of computational power
available. In addition, these systems often struggle to generalize
beyond the specific contexts they were trained in. They lack the common
sense and contextual knowledge that humans often use to make decisions,
leading to errors that may seem obvious to human observers. Moreover,
they often act as <em>black boxes</em> where the internal mechanisms
driving their predictions are <em>opaque</em>, a trait that can be
especially problematic in high-stakes settings.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding ML models is essential to identifying risks
associated with their use.</strong> Deep learning models are prone to
absorbing and replicating biased patterns embedded in their training
data, leading to skewed and possibly discriminatory decisions. Equipped
with this knowledge, we can anticipate such issues and proactively
implement measures to address them, creating more equitable outcomes.
Moreover, an informed understanding of the technical intricacies of AI
systems is instrumental to assessing and incorporating crucial factors
like robustness and interpretability in their development and
deployment. In doing so, we are better able to do things like improve
model performance in various environments and against adversarial
attacks and provide more transparency and accountability. Consequently,
understanding ML models is key to ensuring the responsible and equitable
use of these powerful tools.</p>
<p><strong>The methodologies employed to train models determine the
capabilities and impact of these systems.</strong> Many techniques
exist, each with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and associated safety
or ethical considerations. A system trained with reinforcement learning
might adopt risky or harmful behaviors if these behaviors are
accidentally rewarded during training. This can pose considerable risks,
especially in real-world, high-stakes environments. Similarly, a model
trained using few-shot learning techniques, which rely on learning from
a minimal number of examples, might make crucial decisions based on an
insufficient amount of data. This can introduce inaccuracies,
potentially causing harm or undesired outcomes. Therefore, understanding
the intricacies of different training methods and techniques is vital to
developing robust and ethical AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>AI is poised to become increasingly capable and influential
as technology progresses.</strong> Some of recent AI growth is driven by
advancements in algorithms and techniques, which enable systems to learn
and make predictions more accurately and efficiently as they increase in
sophistication. Concurrently, the development of more powerful and
cost-effective computing technology is facilitating the deployment and
scaling of AI systems, making them more accessible, widespread, and
capable. Moreover, the expanding volume and variety of data available
for training is significantly enhancing their ability to learn and
generalize, thereby broadening their applicability. Together, these
factors—techniques, compute, and data—are accelerating the advancement
of AI systems. AI’s impact on individuals, industries, and society in
the future is only becoming more profound.</p>
