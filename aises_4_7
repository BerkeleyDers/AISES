<h1 id="tail-events">4.7 Tail Events</h1>
<p>In the first few sections of this chapter, we discussed failure modes
and hazards, equations for understanding the risks they pose, and
principles for designing safer systems. We also looked at methods of
analyzing systems to model accidents and identify hazards, and explored
how different styles of analysis can be more helpful for complex
systems.<p>
The classic risk equation from the start of the chapter tells us that
the level of risk of a specific adverse event depends on both the
probability it will happen and its severity. A particular class of
events, called <em>tail events</em>, have a very low probability of
occurrence but a very high impact upon arrival. Tail events pose some
unique challenges for assessing and reducing risk, but any competent
form of risk management must attempt to address them. We will now
explore these events and their implications in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-tail-events">Introduction to Tail Events</h3>
<p>Tail events are events that happen rarely, but have a considerable
impact when they do. Consider some examples of historical tail
events.<p>
<em>The 2007-2008 financial crisis</em>: Fluctuations happen continually
in financial markets, but crises of this scale are rare and have a large
impact, with knock-on effects for banks and the general
population.<p>
<em>The COVID-19 pandemic</em>: There are many outbreaks of infectious
diseases every year, but COVID-19 spread much more widely and killed
many more people than most. It is rare for an outbreak to become a
pandemic, but those that do will have a much larger impact than the
rest.<p>
<em>The Internet</em>: There are many technologies being developed all
the time, but very few become so widely used that they transform society
as much as the Internet has. This example illustrates that some tail
events happen more gradually than others; the development and global
adoption of the internet unfolded over decades, rather than happening as
suddenly as the financial crisis or the pandemic. However, “sudden” is a
relative term. If we look at history on the scale of centuries, then the
transition into the Internet age can also appear to have happened
suddenly.<p>
<em>ChatGPT</em>: After being released in November 2022, ChatGPT gained
100 million users in just two months <span class="citation"
data-cites="hu2023chatgpt">[1]</span>. There are many consumer
applications on the internet, but ChatGPT’s user base grew faster than
those of any others launched before it. Out of many deep learning
models, ChatGPT was the first to go viral in this way. Its release also
represented a watershed moment in the progress of generative AI, placing
the issue much more firmly in the public consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>We need to consider the possibility of harmful tail events in
risk management.</strong> The last two examples—–the Internet and
ChatGPT—–illustrate that the impacts of tail events are not always
strictly negative; they can also be positive or mixed. However, <em>tail
risks</em> are what we need to pay attention to when trying to engineer
safer systems.<p>
Since tail events are rare, it can be tempting to think that we do not
need to worry about them. Indeed, some tail events have not yet happened
once in human history, such as a meteorite strike large enough to cause
global devastation, or an intense solar storm knocking out the power
grid. Nonetheless, tail events have such a high impact that it would be
unwise to ignore the possibility that they could happen. As noted by the
political scientist Scott Sagan: “Things that have never happened before
happen all the time.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="sagan1993limit">[2]</span></p>
<p><strong>AI-related tail events could have a severe impact.</strong>
As AIs are increasingly deployed within society, some tail risks we
should consider include the possibility that an AI could be used to
develop a bioweapon, or that an AI might hack a bank and wipe the
financial information. Even if these eventualities have a low
probability of occurring, it would only take one such event to cause
widespread devastation; if one such event happened, it could largely
define the overall outcome of AI deployment. For this reason, competent
risk management must involve serious efforts to prevent tail events,
however rare we think they might be.<p>

Greatly Affect the Average Risk</h2>

    <p class="tb-caption">Figure 4.10: The occurrence of a tail event can dramatically
shift the mean but not the median of the event type’s impact.</p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>A tail event often changes the mean but not the
median.</strong> Figure 4.10 can help us
visualize how tail events affect the wider risk landscape. The graphs
show data points representing individual events, with their placement
along the x-axis indicating their individual impact.<p>
In the first graph, we have numerous data points representing frequent,
low-impact events: these are all distributed between 0 and 100, and
mostly between 0 and 10. The mean impact and median impact of this
dataset have similar values, marked on the x-axis.<p>
In the second graph we have the same collection of events, but with the
addition of a single data point of much higher impact—a tail event with
an impact of 10,000. As indicated in the graph, the median impact of the
dataset is approximately the same as before, but the mean changes
substantially and is no longer representative of the general population
of events.</p>
<p><strong>We can also think about tail events in terms of the classic
risk equation.</strong> Tail events have a low probability, but because
they are so severe, we nonetheless evaluate the risk they pose as being
large: <span
class="math display">Risk(hazard) = <em>P</em>(hazard) × severity(hazard).</span>
Depending on the exact values of probability and severity, we may find
that tail risks are just as large as—–or even larger than–—the risks
posed by much smaller events that happen all the time. In other words,
although they are rare, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility that
they might happen.</p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to plan for tail events because they are so
rare.</strong> Since we can hardly predict when tail events will happen,
or even if they will happen at all, it is much more challenging to plan
for them than it is for frequent, everyday events that we know we can
expect to encounter. It is often the case that we do not know exactly
what form they will take either.<p>
For these reasons, we cannot plan the specific details of our response
to tail events in advance. For these reasons, we cannot plan the specific 
details of our response to tail events in advance. Instead, we must plan to plan. 
This involves organizing and developing an appropriate response, if and when it is 
necessary---how relevant actors should convene to decide on and coordinate the most 
appropriate next steps, whatever the precise details of the event. Often, we need to
 figure out whether some phenomena even present tail events, for which we need to consider
 their frequency distributions. We consider this concept next.</p>
<h2 id="frequency-distributions">4.7.3 Tail Events Can Be Identified From Frequency Distributions</h2>
<p><strong>Frequency distributions tell us how common instances of
different magnitude are.</strong> To understand the origins of tail
events, we need to understand frequency distributions. These
distributions tell us about the proportion of items in a dataset that
have each possible value of a given variable. Suppose we want to study
some quantity, such as the ages of buildings. We might plot a graph
showing how many buildings there are in the world of each age, and it
might look something like the generic graph shown in Figure 4.11.<p>
The x-axis would represent building age, while the y-axis would indicate
the number of buildings of each age—the frequency of a particular age
appearing in the dataset. If our graph looked like figure 4.11, it would tell us that there are
many buildings that are relatively new, perhaps only a few decades or a
hundred years old, fewer buildings that are several hundred or a
thousand years old, and very few buildings, such as the Pyramids at
Giza, that are several thousand years old.<p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 4.11: Many distributions have a head (an area where most of the probability is concentrated)
and one or two tails (extreme regions of the distribution).</p>
<!--<figcaption>Head and tail of a distribution</figcaption>-->
</figure>
<p><strong>Many real-world frequency distributions have long
tails.</strong> We can plot graphs like this for countless variables,
from the size of different vertebrate species to the number of countries
different people have visited. Each variable will have its own unique
distribution, but many have the general property that there are lots of
occurrences of a low value and relatively few occurrences of a high
value. There are many vertebrate species with a mass of tens of
kilograms, and very few with a mass in the thousands of kilograms; there
are many people who have visited somewhere between 1-10 countries, and
few people who have visited more than 50.
<p>We can determine whether we are likely to observe tail events of a particular type by examining whether its frequency distribution has thin tails or long tails.
 In thin-tailed distributions, tail events do not exist. Examples of thin-tailed distributions include human characteristics such as height, weight, and intelligence.
 No one is over 100 meters tall, weighs over 10,000 kilograms, or has an IQ of 10,000. By contrast, in long-tailed distributions, tail events are possible. Examples of
 long-tailed distributions include book sales, earthquake magnitude, and word frequency. While most books only sell a handful of copies, most earthquakes are relatively
 harmless, and most words are rare and infrequently used, some books sell millions or even billions of copies, some earthquakes flatten cities, and some words (such as 
`the' or `I') are used extremely frequently. Of course, not all distributions neatly fit into a dichotomy of thin-tailed or long-tailed, but may be somewhere in between.</p>

<h2 id="a-caricature-of-long-tails-and-thin-tails">4.7.4 A Caricature of Long
Tails and Thin Tails</h2>
<p>To illustrate the difference between long-tailed and thin-tailed
distributions, we will now run through some comparisons between the two
categories. Note that, with these statements, we are describing
simplified caricatures of the two scenarios, for pedagogical
purposes.<p>
<strong>Under thin tails, the top few receive quite a proportionate
share of the total.</strong> If we were to measure the heights of a
group of people, the total height of the tallest 10% would not be much
more than 10% of the total height of the whole group.<p>
Under long tails, the top few receive a disproportionately large share
of the total. For example, in the music industry, the revenue earned by
the most successful 1% of artists represents around 77% of the total
revenue earned by all artists.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the total is determined by the whole
group.</strong> The total height of the tallest 10% of people is not a
very good approximation of the total height of the whole group. Most
members need to be included to get a good measure of the total. This is
called “tyranny of the collective.”</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the total is determined by a few extreme
occurrences.</strong> As discussed above, the most successful 1% of
artists earn 77% of the total revenue earned by all artists. 77% is a
fairly good approximation of the total. In fact, it is a better
approximation than the revenue earned by the remaining 99% of artists
would be. This is called “tyranny of the accidental.”</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the typical member of a group has an
average value.</strong> Almost no members are going to be much smaller
or much larger than the mean.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the typical member is either a giant or a
dwarf.</strong> Members can generally be classified as being either
extreme and high-impact or relatively insignificant.<p>
Note that, under many real-world long-tailed distributions, there may be
occurrences that seem to fall between these two categories. There may be
no clear boundary dividing occurrences that count as insignificant from
those that count as extreme. However, with these statements, we are
describing a caricature of long tails, for pedagogical purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the impact of an event is not
scalable.</strong> A single event cannot escalate to become much bigger
than the average.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the impact of an event is
scalable.</strong> A single event can escalate to become much bigger
than many others put together.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, individual data points vary within a small
range that is close to the mean.</strong> Even the data point that is
furthest from the mean does not change the mean of the whole group by
much.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, individual data points can vary across many
orders of magnitude.</strong> A single extreme data point can completely
change the mean of the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, we can predict roughly what value a single
instance will take.</strong> We can be confident that our prediction
will not be far off, since instances cannot stray too far from the
mean.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, it is much harder to predict even the rough
value that a single instance will take.</strong> Since data points can
vary much more widely, our best guesses can be much further off.</p>

<p>Having laid the foundations for understanding tail events in general, we will now consider an important subset of tail events: black swans.</p>
