<h1 id="tail-events">4.6 Tail Events</h1>
<p>In the first few sections of this chapter, we discussed failure modes
and hazards, equations for understanding the risks they pose, and
principles for designing safer systems. We also looked at methods of
analyzing systems to model accidents and identify hazards, and explored
how different styles of analysis can be more helpful for complex
systems.<p>
The classic risk equation from the start of the chapter tells us that
the level of risk of a specific adverse event depends on both the
probability it will happen and its severity. A particular class of
events, called <em>tail events</em>, have a very low probability of
occurrence but a very high impact upon arrival. Tail events pose some
unique challenges for assessing and reducing risk, but any competent
form of risk management must attempt to address them. We will now
explore these events and their implications in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-tail-events">Introduction to Tail Events</h3>
<p>Tail events are events that happen rarely, but have a considerable
impact when they do. Consider some examples of historical tail
events.<p>
<em>The 2007-2008 financial crisis</em>: Fluctuations happen continually
in financial markets, but crises of this scale are rare and have a large
impact, with knock-on effects for banks and the general
population.<p>
<em>The COVID-19 pandemic</em>: There are many outbreaks of infectious
diseases every year, but COVID-19 spread much more widely and killed
many more people than most. It is rare for an outbreak to become a
pandemic, but those that do will have a much larger impact than the
rest.<p>
<em>The Internet</em>: There are many technologies being developed all
the time, but very few become so widely used that they transform society
as much as the Internet has. This example illustrates that some tail
events happen more gradually than others; the development and global
adoption of the internet unfolded over decades, rather than happening as
suddenly as the financial crisis or the pandemic. However, “sudden” is a
relative term. If we look at history on the scale of centuries, then the
transition into the Internet age can also appear to have happened
suddenly.<p>
<em>ChatGPT</em>: After being released in November 2022, ChatGPT gained
100 million users in just two months <span class="citation"
data-cites="hu2023chatgpt">[1]</span>. There are many consumer
applications on the internet, but ChatGPT’s user base grew faster than
those of any others launched before it. Out of many deep learning
models, ChatGPT was the first to go viral in this way. Its release also
represented a watershed moment in the progress of generative AI, placing
the issue much more firmly in the public consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>We need to consider the possibility of harmful tail events in
risk management.</strong> The last two examples—–the Internet and
ChatGPT—–illustrate that the impacts of tail events are not always
strictly negative; they can also be positive or mixed. However, <em>tail
risks</em> are what we need to pay attention to when trying to engineer
safer systems.<p>
Since tail events are rare, it can be tempting to think that we do not
need to worry about them. Indeed, some tail events have not yet happened
once in human history, such as a meteorite strike large enough to cause
global devastation, or an intense solar storm knocking out the power
grid. Nonetheless, tail events have such a high impact that it would be
unwise to ignore the possibility that they could happen. As noted by the
political scientist Scott Sagan: “Things that have never happened before
happen all the time.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="sagan1993limit">[2]</span></p>
<p><strong>AI-related tail events could have a severe impact.</strong>
As AIs are increasingly deployed within society, some tail risks we
should consider include the possibility that an AI could be used to
develop a bioweapon, or that an AI might hack a bank and wipe the
financial information. Even if these eventualities have a low
probability of occurring, it would only take one such event to cause
widespread devastation; if one such event happened, it could largely
define the overall outcome of AI deployment. For this reason, competent
risk management must involve serious efforts to prevent tail events,
however rare we think they might be.<p>

Greatly Affect the Average Risk</h2>

    <p class="tb-caption">Figure 4.7.1 Shift in mean due to one tail event (but no shift in median).</p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>A tail event often changes the mean but not the
median.</strong> Figure <a href="#wrap-fig:tails"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="wrap-fig:tails">[wrap-fig:tails]</a> can help us
visualize how tail events affect the wider risk landscape. The graphs
show data points representing individual events, with their placement
along the x-axis indicating their individual impact.<p>
In the first graph, we have numerous data points representing frequent,
low-impact events: these are all distributed between 0 and 100, and
mostly between 0 and 10. The mean impact and median impact of this
dataset have similar values, marked on the x-axis.<p>
In the second graph we have the same collection of events, but with the
addition of a single data point of much higher impact—a tail event with
an impact of 10,000. As indicated in the graph, the median impact of the
dataset is approximately the same as before, but the mean changes
substantially and is no longer representative of the general population
of events.</p>
<p><strong>We can also think about tail events in terms of the classic
risk equation.</strong> Tail events have a low probability, but because
they are so severe, we nonetheless evaluate the risk they pose as being
large: <span
class="math display">Risk(hazard) = <em>P</em>(hazard) × severity(hazard).</span>
Depending on the exact values of probability and severity, we may find
that tail risks are just as large as—–or even larger than–—the risks
posed by much smaller events that happen all the time. In other words,
although they are rare, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility that
they might happen.</p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to plan for tail events because they are so
rare.</strong> Since we can hardly predict when tail events will happen,
or even if they will happen at all, it is much more challenging to plan
for them than it is for frequent, everyday events that we know we can
expect to encounter. It is often the case that we do not know exactly
what form they will take either.<p>
For these reasons, we cannot plan the specific details of our response
to tail events in advance. Instead, we have to plan how we will organize
and develop an appropriate response, if and when it is necessary—–how
relevant actors should convene to decide on and coordinate the most
appropriate next steps, whatever the precise details of the event. This
concept is called “planning to plan” and we will discuss this in more
detail later in the chapter.</p>
<h2 id="long-tailed-and-thin-tailed-distributions">4.7.2 Long-Tailed and
Thin-Tailed Distributions</h2>
<p>Having introduced tail events and briefly explained why they are
important, we will now discuss the difference between the types of
events that have long tails and the types of events that do not. First,
we will briefly consider what frequency distributions are. Then, we will
go through the characteristics of long-tailed and thin-tailed
distributions, distinguishing between them and examining a few important
features of long-tailed distributions wherein we see tail events.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-distributions">Frequency distributions</h3>
<p><strong>Frequency distributions tell us how common instances of
different magnitude are.</strong> To understand the origins of tail
events, we need to understand frequency distributions. These
distributions tell us about the proportion of items in a dataset that
have each possible value of a given variable. Suppose we want to study
some quantity, such as the ages of buildings. We might plot a graph
showing how many buildings there are in the world of each age, and it
might look something like the generic graph shown in figure <a
href="#fig:exponential" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:exponential">1</a>.<p>
The x-axis would represent building age, while the y-axis would indicate
the number of buildings of each age—the frequency of a particular age
appearing in the dataset. If our graph looked like figure <a
href="#fig:exponential" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:exponential">1</a>, it would tell us that there are
many buildings that are relatively new, perhaps only a few decades or a
hundred years old, fewer buildings that are several hundred or a
thousand years old, and very few buildings, such as the Pyramids at
Giza, that are several thousand years old.<p>
</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Head and tail of a distribution</p>
<!--<figcaption>Head and tail of a distribution</figcaption>-->
</figure>
<p><strong>Many real-world frequency distributions have long
tails.</strong> We can plot graphs like this for countless variables,
from the size of different vertebrate species to the number of countries
different people have visited. Each variable will have its own unique
distribution, but many have the general property that there are lots of
occurrences of a low value and relatively few occurrences of a high
value. There are many vertebrate species with a mass of tens of
kilograms, and very few with a mass in the thousands of kilograms; there
are many people who have visited somewhere between 1-10 countries, and
few people who have visited more than 50.<p>
Frequency distributions can generally be categorized as being either
long-tailed or thin-tailed. To develop our understanding of tail events,
we need to understand the difference between these two categories.</p>
<h3 id="long-tailed-distributions">Long-tailed distributions</h3>
<p><strong>In long-tailed distributions, extreme occurrences can have a
huge effect.</strong> Long-tailed distributions are those where values
can vary so much that a single extreme instance or a few extreme
instances can dominate the total value. In other words, the top few
instances have a highly disproportionate impact. We will now explore
some examples of variables with long-tailed distributions.<p>
<em>Book sales</em>: Around 0.2% of books account for around 50% of
total book sales. It is possible for a single, highly popular book to
sell many more copies than many less popular books combined. Such a book
might be termed a tail event within book sales.<p>
<em>Music</em>: Around 1% of artists in the music industry earn around
77% of the total revenue from all recorded music. A single, highly
successful artist can earn much more than many lesser-known artists
combined.<p>
<em>Net worth</em>: Wealth distribution is a classic example of a
long-tailed distribution. Global wealth reports frequently find that the
richest 1% of people own close to half of the world’s total
wealth.<p>
<em>Web hits</em>: There are around 200 million actively maintained
websites on the internet, but the vast majority receive very few
visitors. A single, highly popular website, such as YouTube or Facebook,
can receive many more visitors per day than many obscure websites put
together.<p>
<em>Earthquake magnitude</em>: The frequency distribution of earthquake
magnitudes is described by the Gutenberg-Richter law. The exact
distribution depends on the region and conditions, but typically, there
are around 10,000 times more earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or above than
earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or above. However, a single magnitude-7
earthquake can do much more damage than all the magnitude-3 earthquakes
combined.<p>
<em>Crater diameter</em>: Most impact craters, resulting from collisions
with other astronomical bodies, are relatively small. Out of around 200
such craters discovered on Earth, about 120 are between 0 km and 10 km
in diameter, while fewer than 10 have a diameter of 100 km or more.
Moreover, the 5% largest craters have a combined diameter of around a
third of the total diameter of all craters.<p>
<em>Solar flares</em>: Solar flares of relatively low intensity are
quite common, while solar flares of much higher intensity happen
infrequently. However, studies have found that the few large flares
mostly determine the total energy of all flares.<p>
<em>Word frequency</em>: The vast majority of words in a given text
appear infrequently. However, certain words, like “the,” “of,” and
“and,” appear far more frequently than most others. The total
appearances of a handful of these commonplace words can outweigh the
total appearances of a large number of rarer words.<p>
These variables are said to have a long tail because, in their frequency
distributions, the rare, extreme events appear at very large values of
x; the “tail” of the graph extends far along the x-axis. This is also
why rare, high-impact events are called tail events; they exist in the
tail end of a long-tailed distribution.<p>
This type of phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “Pareto
principle” or “the 80-20 rule.” This asserts that, in many
distributions, 20% of the instances contribute 80% of the total outcome.
The exact figures depend on the variable, but the 80-20 rule is a
well-known framing of the general concept of long-tailed
distributions.</p>
<h3 id="thin-tailed-distributions">Thin-tailed distributions</h3>
<p><strong>In thin-tailed distributions, no event is extreme enough to
have much effect.</strong> Thin-tailed distributions are those with
relatively little variation between values, meaning that even the most
extreme instances cannot substantially affect the overall landscape.
Many human characteristics, such as height, general intelligence, and
lifespan, have thin-tailed distributions. Note that these examples all
follow something akin to a normal distribution, or bell curve, as shown
in . Normal distributions have a maximum density at the most common
value and a tail on either side. The frequency decreases rapidly as we
move away from the most common value.</p>
<figure id="fig:excess">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamHodgkins/AISES/main/images/heights_v2.png" class="tb-img-full" style="width: 70%"/>
<p class="tb-caption">Normal distribution: human heights.</p>
<!--<figcaption>Normal distribution: human heights.<p>-->
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All of these example characteristics vary between individuals, but
the range of variation is much narrower than it is for variables with
long-tailed distributions. For example, while human height varies, there
has never been a person who was fifty feet tall. Even the tallest person
in the world is not ten times taller than the shortest. This contrasts
with long-tailed distributions such as book sales, where a bestseller
can easily sell thousands of times more copies than a less popular
book.<p>
Following on from this, under thin-tailed distributions, no single
instance is so extreme that it can account for a large share of the
total among a group; the total height of the tallest 10% of people will
not be significantly more than 10% of the total height of all people.
Again, this contrasts with long-tailed distributions, where a small
fraction of instances can account for most of the impact.<p>
Thin-tailed distributions are so-called because, in their frequency
distributions, the value on the y-axis rapidly approaches zero for
highly extreme events; the “tail” of the graph quickly becomes
vanishingly thin.</p>
<h2
id="heuristics-and-models-for-thinking-about-long-tails-and-thin-tails">4.7.3 Heuristics
and Models for Thinking About Long Tails and Thin Tails</h2>
<p><strong>Generally, long-tailed variables span orders of magnitude and
thin-tailed ones do not.</strong> A general rule of thumb for
distinguishing between long-tailed and thin-tailed variables is to ask:
Does it still make sense if we add a zero at the end of a data point’s
value? In other words, can the variable span multiple orders of
magnitude? If the answer is no, it is more likely to be thin-tailed; if
yes, the variable is more likely to be long-tailed.<p>
We should note that this test is imperfect. Lifespan is a thin-tailed
variable that spans orders of magnitude; some live to be over 100 years
old, while others live for fewer than ten years. Nonetheless, this
question usually indicates whether a variable has a long or thin
tail.<p>

    style="width:70%" class="tb-img-full"/>
    <p class="tb-caption">Long tailed vs exponential distributions</p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Exponential distributions are thin-tailed
distributions.</strong> Figure <a href="#wrap-fig:exponentials"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="wrap-fig:exponentials">[wrap-fig:exponentials]</a> shows
an exponential distribution (in black) and a power-law distribution (in
grey). At first glance, they look quite similar. However, in the second
and third graphs, we zoom in to the tail end of the graph and change the
y-axis to a logarithmic scale. Here, we can see that, beyond a certain
point, the exponential distribution decays significantly more quickly
than the power-law distribution. As a rough heuristic, frequency
distributions that decay more slowly than an exponential are generally
considered long-tailed, while those that decay more quickly are
considered thin-tailed.</p>
<p><strong>There is a significant difference between extreme events
being unlikely and astronomicallyunlikely.</strong> In practical terms,
foreventswith exponential distributions—and distributions that decay
more quickly than them—the probability of extreme events rapidly becomes
astronomically small. In fact, it becomes so small that, at some point,
we can consider it essentially zero. Under distributions that decay more
slowly than exponentials, such as the power law depicted, the
probability of extreme events is still low. The important difference,
however, is that they are possible. Under long-tailed distributions,
they are rare but possible and have an enormous impact if they
happen.<p>
Note that the frequency of extreme events depends on how we define
“extreme,” namely, how far along the x-axis the event appears. We use
“extreme” to describe events so far from the most common value that they
can significantly impact the mean and represent a disproportionately
large fraction of the total.<p>
Returning to the risk equation, under thin-tailed distributions, the
probability, <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>(hazard), of a
tail event is so astronomically small that tail events do not affect the
total risk much. Under long-tailed distributions, the probability, <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>(hazard), of a tail event is small,
but the severity is so large that tail events can substantially alter
the total risk.<p>
<span
class="math display">Risk(hazard) = <em>P</em>(hazard) × severity(hazard)</span></p>
<p>Next, we will consider three specific differentiators of long- and
thin-tailed distributions: excess conditional expectation,
multiplicative vs. additive phenomena, and preferential attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Excess conditional expectation is the margin between minimum
and actual values.</strong> Another difference between long-tailed and
thin-tailed distributions is the “excess conditional expectation” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Marsden2017">[3]</span>. This is the
difference between the conditional expectation–—our best guess of how
large something will be, given that we know that it is already above or
below some threshold—–and the threshold itself. Only long-tailed
distributions tend to have high excess conditional expectation. This
concept is best illustrated with examples.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Long Jump, Thin Tails.</strong> Imagine we are at a
training session for long-jump athletes. The world record for the long
jump is around 9 meters. If an athlete jumps 7 meters at the training
session, then this represents a definite lower bound for their personal
best: it is at least 7 meters. If we are then asked to guess their
actual personal best, we might estimate that it could be close to 8
meters.<p>
If another athlete jumps 8 meters at the training session, then we might
expect that their personal best is around 8.5 meters. If yet another
athlete jumps 8.5 meters, then we might think their personal best is
around 8.7 meters.<p>
Figure <a href="#fig:excess" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:excess">3</a> shows a plot of the observed jumps as
blue dots, and our best guess of each athlete’s personal best in dotted
lines. Notice how, as the definite minimum value increases, we observe a
shrinking margin between this lower bound and our estimate of the
athlete’s actual maximum jump. This is because we know that the world
record sets a definite limit on what any individual’s personal best
could be. The closer the observed distance gets to the world record, the
less room there is for the athlete to have jumped further.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, excess conditional expectation shrinks as
values get more extreme.</strong> The margin between the known lower
bound of something and the estimate of its actual value is the excess
conditional expectation. Under thin-tailed distributions, this margin
tends to shrink as the minimum value becomes more extreme. This is
because there is a limit to how extreme it can become; as the lower
bound approaches that limit, there is less room for the actual value to
be different.<p>
</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Head and tail of a distribution</p>
<!--<figcaption>Head and tail of a distribution</figcaption>-->
</figure>
<p><strong>Example: Lindy Effect, Long Tails.</strong> The Lindy Effect
is the theory that, for certain types of entities, such as technologies
and ideas, the longer they have been around, the longer we can expect
them to survive into the future <span class="citation"
data-cites="ord2023lindy">[4]</span>.<p>
For example, if a book has been in print for two years, then it might
remain in print for another two years. However, most books do not “stand
the test of time,” so we might not expect it to survive another 100
years. Meanwhile, if another book has already been in print for 100
years, then we might well expect it to remain so for another 100 because
it has showed it is robust to the test of time; if it has already
remained relevant and interesting for a long time, then it is more
likely to continue to do so for a long time into the future.<p>
Figure <a href="#fig:excess" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:excess">3</a> shows some hypothetical observations
of the current ages of books as blue lines, and our estimate of what
their actual lifespan will be in dotted lines. Notice how, as the known
lower bound of lifespan increases, the amount of additional time we
expect a book to survive also increases.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, excess conditional expectation grows as
values become more extreme.</strong> Under long tails, values of
individual occurrences can grow much more extreme compared to the
majority. There is not usually as clear a limit on long-tailed variables
as on thin-tailed variables, so there is more room for the actual value
to differ from the known minimum value, even if the latter is already
extreme.<p>
To differentiate between thin- and long-tailed distributions, we have
now explored excess conditional distribution, a measure of the
difference between our expectation of real-world values and the
thresholds we observe them to exceed. Next, we will consider how
variables arise: multiplicatively or additively.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplicative and additive phenomena</strong> One factor in
determining whether a variable is likely to have a long-tailed or
thin-tailed distribution is whether it arises from a multiplicative or
additive phenomenon. We will now look at the differences between these
two categories of phenomena and why they affect how extreme a variable
can become.</p>
<p><strong>With multiplicative phenomena, one instance can multiply
rapidly, triggering a cascade.</strong> When something is a
multiplicative phenomenon, individual instances are not independent of
one another. Virus infections are a classic example of this; one
infection is likely to seed several more infections, each of which can
go on to cause even more. Thus, a single infection can trigger a
cascade, so a virus outbreak has the potential to scale up considerably.
This is part of the reason why virus outbreaks have a long-tailed
distribution, with pandemics representing tail events.</p>
<p><strong>With additive phenomena, individual instances do not tend to
multiply.</strong> When something is an additive phenomenon, individual
events are largely independent of one another. Broken bones are an
example of this; one person falling and breaking a bone does not usually
trigger a cascade of other people falling and breaking bones. There may
be instances where multiple broken bones occur together, for example in
a car accident. However, in general, they are independently caused and
do not have the potential to scale up as an infectious disease can. This
means that tail events do not generally happen with this phenomenon;
there is no single event where so many bones are broken that it
significantly affects the average number of bones broken in
accidents.</p>
<p><strong>A high level of connectedness in a system gives rise to long
tails.</strong> Another way of thinking about this is to consider the
level of connectedness in the relevant system. Since viruses are
infectious, instances of infection are strongly connected to one
another. Broken bones are not infectious, so instances of them are
relatively isolated from one another.<p>
We have seen that multiplicative phenomena are much more likely to
result in long-tailed variables than additive ones. Next, we discuss
another model which gives rise to long tails: preferential
attachment.</p>
<p><strong>In preferential attachment processes, the more someone has,
the more they will receive.</strong> Preferential attachment processes
are mechanisms where the amount extra of something that an individual
will receive is positively correlated with the amount they already have.
This is also known as the “rich get richer” effect because it is often
illustrated with the example of wealth distribution; the more money a
person already has, the more money they can invest, and thus the more
additional money they can make through returns on their investments.</p>
<p>This effect applies to many phenomena within social systems. For
example, if an author already has a lot of readers, there are more
people who are likely to recommend their books to others. This author is
therefore likely to gain more additional readers than someone else who
starts out with fewer readers. Their sales can therefore snowball and
become a tail event in the context of book sales. Similar mechanisms can
also explain why a few social media platforms vastly outperform others,
and why a few scientific papers receive many more citations than
most.</p>
<p><strong>Preferential attachment processes give rise to long tails
<span class="citation" data-cites="Marsden2017">[3]</span>.</strong> In
situations where preferential attachment processes take place, events
are not independent of one another. This is why things like book sales
and wealth acquisition are multiplicative phenomena, where a single
event can escalate to become much larger than most. By extension, this
is why preferential attachment processes can produce long-tailed
distributions.</p>
<h2 id="a-caricature-of-long-tails-and-thin-tails">4.7.4 A Caricature of Long
Tails and Thin Tails</h2>
<p>To cement our understanding of long-tailed and thin-tailed
distributions, we will now run through some comparisons between the two
categories. Note that, with these statements, we are describing
simplified caricatures of the two scenarios, for pedagogical
purposes.<p>
<strong>Under thin tails, the top few receive quite a proportionate
share of the total.</strong> If we were to measure the heights of a
group of people, the total height of the tallest 10% would not be much
more than 10% of the total height of the whole group.<p>
Under long tails, the top few receive a disproportionately large share
of the total. For example, in the music industry, the revenue earned by
the most successful 1% of artists represents around 77% of the total
revenue earned by all artists.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the total is determined by the whole
group.</strong> The total height of the tallest 10% of people is not a
very good approximation of the total height of the whole group. Most
members need to be included to get a good measure of the total. This is
called “tyranny of the collective.”</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the total is determined by a few extreme
occurrences.</strong> As discussed above, the most successful 1% of
artists earn 77% of the total revenue earned by all artists. 77% is a
fairly good approximation of the total. In fact, it is a better
approximation than the revenue earned by the remaining 99% of artists
would be. This is called “tyranny of the accidental.”</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the typical member of a group has an
average value.</strong> Almost no members are going to be much smaller
or much larger than the mean.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the typical member is either a giant or a
dwarf.</strong> Members can generally be classified as being either
extreme and high-impact or relatively insignificant.<p>
Note that, under many real-world long-tailed distributions, there may be
occurrences that seem to fall between these two categories. There may be
no clear boundary dividing occurrences that count as insignificant from
those that count as extreme. However, with these statements, we are
describing a caricature of long tails, for pedagogical purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, the impact of an event is not
scalable.</strong> A single event cannot escalate to become much bigger
than the average.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, the impact of an event is
scalable.</strong> A single event can escalate to become much bigger
than many others put together.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, individual data points vary within a small
range that is close to the mean.</strong> Even the data point that is
furthest from the mean does not change the mean of the whole group by
much.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, individual data points can vary across many
orders of magnitude.</strong> A single extreme data point can completely
change the mean of the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Under thin tails, we can predict roughly what value a single
instance will take.</strong> We can be confident that our prediction
will not be far off, since instances cannot stray too far from the
mean.</p>
<p><strong>Under long tails, it is much harder to predict even the rough
value that a single instance will take.</strong> Since data points can
vary much more widely, our best guesses can be much further off.</p>
