<h1 id="sec:evo-pressures">7.5 Evolutionary Pressures</h1>
<h2 id="overview">7.5.1 Overview</h2>
<p>This central focus of this chapter concerns the dynamics we expect in
a multi-AI agent future. We must consider the risks that emerge from the
interactions between these agents, and between humans and AI
agents. In this last part of the Collective Action Problems chapter, we 
use evolutionary theory to explore what happens when competitive pressures 
play out over a longer time period, operating on a large group of interacting agents. 
Exploring evolutionary pressures helps us understand the risks posed by the influence 
of natural selection on AI development. Our ultimate conclusions are that AI development
 is likely to be subject to evolutionary forces, and that we should expect the default 
outcome of this influence to be the promotion of selfish and undesirable AI behavior.<p>
<p> We begin this section by looking at how evolution
by natural selection can operate in non-biological domains, an idea
known as “generalized Darwinism.” We formalize this idea using the
conditions set out by Lewontin as necessary and sufficient for natural
selection, and Price’s equation for describing evolutionary change over
time. We thus set out the case that evolutionary pressures are
influencing AIs. We turn to the ramifications of this claim in the
second section.</p>
<p>We next move onto exploring why evolutionary pressures may 
promote selfish AI behavior. To consider what traits and strategies 
natural selection tends to favor, we begin by setting out the
“information’s eye view” of evolution as a generalized Darwinian
extrapolation of the “gene’s eye view” of biological evolution. Using
this framing, we examine how conflict can arise within a system when the
interests of propagating information clash with those of the entity that
contains the information. Internal conflict of this kind could arise
within AI systems, distorting or subverting goals even when they are
specified and understood correctly. Finally, we explore why natural
selection tends to favor selfish strategies over altruistic ones. Our
upshot is that AI development is likely to be subject to evolutionary
pressures. These pressures may distort the goals we specify if the
interests of internal components of the AI system clash, and could also
generate a trend towards increasingly selfish AI behavior.</p>
<h2 id="generalized-darwinism">7.3.2 Generalized Darwinism </h2>
<p>Our aim in this section is to understand <em>generalized
Darwinism</em>—the idea that Darwinian mechanisms are a useful way to
explain many phenomena outside of biology <span class="citation"
data-cites="dawkins1983universal">[1]</span>—and how we can use this as
a helpful model for modeling AI development. Using examples ranging from
science to music, we examine how evolution by natural selection can
operate in non-biological systems. We formalize this process using the
conditions for natural selection and consider how AI development meets
these criteria and is therefore subject to evolutionary pressures.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-framework-for-generalized-darwinism">Conceptual
Framework for Generalized Darwinism</h3>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is not confined to the domain of
biological organisms. We can model many other phenomena using Darwinian
mechanisms. In this section, we use a range of examples to elaborate
this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Darwinism: natural selection can be applied to
non-biological phenomena.</strong> Evolution by natural selection does
not depend on mechanisms particular to biology <span class="citation"
data-cites="Smolin1992DidTU">[2]</span>. Darwin proposed that
populations change over the course of generations when differences among
individuals help some reproduce more than others, so that eventually,
the population is made up of descendants of those that reproduced the
most. Darwin understood that this idea could explain many other
phenomena. For instance, he suggested that natural selection could
explain the evolution of language: “The survival or preservation of
certain favored words in the struggle for existence is natural
selection” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dennett1995DarwinsDI">[3]</span>.<p>
As an example, Richard Dawkins has argued that human culture developed
according to the principles of natural selection <span class="citation"
data-cites="dawkins2006selfish">[4]</span>. A piece of cultural
information, such as a song, is passed down over generations, often with
small changes, and some songs remain very well-known even over very long
time periods. The 18th century French tune “Ah! Vous dirai-je, Maman”
was pleasing and easy to sing, so the young Mozart wrote a version of
it, and it was later used as the tune for the English poem “The Star,”
which was sung over and over, until today, when many people know it as
“Twinkle Twinkle,” “The Alphabet Song,” or “Baa Baa Black Sheep” <span
class="citation" data-cites="blackmore1999meme">[5]</span>. There were
many other 18th century songs that have long since been forgotten, but
that one has spread to many people over centuries, due to it being more
memorable and “catchy” than others of its time.</p>
<p><strong>By applying this Darwinian lens, we can describe many
non-biological phenomena.</strong> In nature, evolution happens when
individuals have a variety of traits, and individuals with some traits
propagate more than others. If a species of insect can be either red or
brown, but the brown ones blend in better and are less likely to be
eaten by birds, then more of the red insects will get eaten before
reproducing, while brown insects will tend to have more descendants.
Over time, the population will consist primarily of brown insects.<p>
We note a similar pattern in other, non-biological domains. For example,
alchemy was once a popular way of explaining the relationships among
different metals. People who believed in alchemy taught it to their
students, who taught it to their own students in turn, often with small
differences. Over time, some of those ideas continued to help them
explain the world, and others didn’t. In this respect, chemistry could
be viewed as a descendant of alchemy. The ideas that define it now were
propagated when they helped us increase our understanding of the natural
world, while others were discarded. In the same vein, after the first
widespread video conferencing services were developed, similar products
proliferated. Users chose the product that best met their needs,
selecting for services that were cheap, easy to use, and reliable. Each
company regularly released new versions of its product that were
slightly adapted from earlier ones, and competitors imitated and thereby
propagated the best features and implemented them into their own. Some
products incorporated the most adaptive features quickly, and the
descendants of those products are the ones we use today—–while others
were quickly outcompeted and fell into obscurity.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Darwinism does not imply that evolution produces
good outcomes.</strong> Often, things that are the best at propagating
are not “good” in any meaningful sense. Invasive species arrive in a new
location, propagate quickly, and local ecosystems begin to crumble. The
forms of media that are most successful at propagating in our minds may
be harmful to our happiness and social relationships. For instance, news
articles that get more clicks are likely to have their click-attracting
traits reproduced in the next generation. Clicks thus select for more
sensational, emotionally charged headlines. In the context of AI,
generalized Darwinism poses significant risks. To see why, we first need
to understand how many phenomena tend to develop based on Darwinian
principles, so that we can think about how to predict and mitigate these
risks.<p>
</p>
<h2 id="formalizing-generalized-darwinism">7.3.3 Formalizing Generalized
Darwinism</h2>
<p>In this section, we formalize generalized Darwinism. First, we
overview the criteria necessary and sufficient for evolution by natural
selection to operate on a system. Second, we examine how we might
predict what happens to a system that meets these conditions. Together,
these help us to see why “survival of the fittest” is a poor description
of evolution by natural selection. Instead, this process would be better
described as “propagation of the better-propagated information.”</p>
<p><strong>Lewontin’s three conditions for evolution by natural
selection.</strong> The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin
formulated three criteria necessary and sufficient for evolution by
natural selection <span class="citation"
data-cites="lewontin1970units">[6]</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Variation</strong>: There is variation in traits among
individuals</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retention</strong>: Future iterations of individuals tend
to resemble previous iterations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differential fitness</strong>: Different variants have
different propagation rates</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The validity of these criteria does not depend on biology. In living
organisms, DNA encodes the variations among individuals. Traits encoded
by DNA are heritable, and subject to selection. But this is not the only
way to fulfill the Lewontin conditions. Video conferencing software has
variation (there are many different options), retention (today’s video
conferencing software is similar to last year’s), and differential
fitness (some products are much more widely used and imitated than
others). Precisely how change occurs depends on the specific
phenomenon’s mechanism of propagation.</p>
<p><strong>The Price Equation describes how a trait changes in frequency
over time.</strong> In the 1970s, the population geneticist George R.
Price derived an equation that provides a mathematical description of
natural selection <span class="citation"
data-cites="Price1970SelectionAC">[7]</span>. One formulation of Price’s
equation is given here:<p>
<span
class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>z̄</em> = Cov(<em>ω</em>,<em>z</em>) + E<sub><em>w</em></sub>(<em>Δ</em><em>z</em>).</span></p>
<p>In this equation, <span class="math inline"><em>z̄</em></span> denotes
the average value of some trait <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> in a population, and <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>z̄</em></span> is the change in the
average value of <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> between the
parent generation and the offspring generation. If <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> is height, and the parent
generation is 5 ’5 " on average and the next generation is 5’ 7” on
average, then <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>z̄</em></span> is 2
inches. <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span> is relative fitness:
how many offspring does an individual have relative to the average for
their generation? <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>w</em></sub>(<em>Δ</em><em>z</em>)</span>
is the expected value of <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>z</em></span>: that is, the average
change in <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> between
generations, weighted by fitness, so that individuals who have more
offspring are counted more heavily.</p>
<p>Price’s Equation shows that the change in the average value of some
trait between parents and offspring is equal to the sum of a) the
covariance of the trait value and the fitness of the parents, and b) the
fitness-weighted average of the change in the trait between a parent and
its offspring. “Covariance” describes the phenomenon of one variable
varying together with another. To see whether a population will get
taller over time, for example, we would need to know the covariance of
fitness with height (do tall individuals have more surviving offspring?)
and the difference between a parent’s height and their average child’s
height.</p>
<p><strong>The Price Equation can be applied to non-biological
systems.</strong> The Price Equation does not require any understanding
of what causes a trait to be passed down to a subsequent generation or
why some individuals have more offspring than others, only of how much
the trait <em>is</em> passed on and how much it covaries with fitness.
The Price Equation would work just as well with car designs or tunes as
with birds or mollusks.</p>
<p><strong>The Price Equation allows us to predict what happens when
Lewontin conditions apply.</strong> The Price equation uses differences
between members of the parent generation with respect to some trait
<span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> (variation), similarities
between parent and offspring generation with respect to <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> (retention), and differential
fitness (selection). As a result, when we understand the degree to which
each of the Lewontin conditions apply, we can predict how much of some
trait will be present in subsequent generations <span class="citation"
data-cites="Okasha2007EvolutionAT">[8]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>First misunderstanding: “fitness” does not describe physical
power.</strong> The idea of “fitness” often brings to mind a contest of
physical power, in which the strongest or fastest organism wins, but
this is a misunderstanding. Fitness in an evolutionary sense is not
something we gain at the gym. Being fit may not necessarily entail being
exceptionally good at any specific abilities. Sea sponges, for example,
are among the most ancient of animal lineages, and they are not quick,
clever, or good at chasing prey, especially when compared to, say, a
shark. But empirically, sea sponges have been surviving and reproducing
for hundreds of millions of years, much more than many species that
would easily beat them in head-to-head contests at almost any other
challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Second misunderstanding: “fitness” is not the mechanism
driving evolution.</strong> Biologists often talk about fitness when
discussing how well-suited an organism is to its environment. In
particular, they often treat fitness as a short-hand for <em>relative
reproductive success</em>: how much an individual contributes to the
next generation’s gene pool, relative to their competitors. However,
this usage of the word “fitness” seems to present evolution as being
fundamentally tautological. In the idiom “survival of the fittest,” we
appear to be using both “survival” and “fit” to mean <em>relative
reproductive</em> success. This would suggest that evolution is merely
the process in which those who reproduce more successfully, reproduce
more successfully! If true, the theory of evolution would seem to be
using its own conclusion to demonstrate its argument. As we shall see
next, however, this is actually false.</p>
<p><strong>“Fitness” is simply a metric we use to measure propagation
rate.</strong> In fact, evolutionary theory does <em>not</em> rely on
circular logic. This is because an organism’s fitness does not determine
its reproductive success; natural selection does. Instead, “fitness” is
simply the word we use to describe and measure propagation success.
Those who are better at propagating their information (by surviving and
reproducing) don’t have some “being fit” property which causes their
success. Rather, we deem how “fit” they are by measuring how successful
they’ve been at propagating their information. Thus the phrase “survival
of the fittest” should really be “propagation of the better-propagated
information.”<p>
The Price Equation, and natural selection more broadly, simply says that
if a trait helps individuals survive longer or reproduce more, and that
trait is passed on to the offspring, then more of the next generation
will have that trait. It does not tell us why a trait leads to an
individual having more offspring; it is only a way of expressing the
fact that some traits do correlate with having more offspring. The same
is true when natural selection is applied to non-biological systems;
“fitness” is simply a word for the quality of propagating more. The
information that propagates best is, of course, the information that
propagates best. But it need not be, and often is not, “better” in any
other sense. Fitness is a metric that describes how much information
propagates, not an assessment of value.</p>
<h2 id="generalized-darwinism-and-ai-populations">7.3.4 Generalized Darwinism
and AI Populations </h2>
<p>The three Lewontin conditions, of variation, retention, and
differential fitness, are all that is needed for evolution by natural
selection. This means we can assess how natural selection is likely to
affect AI populations by considering how the conditions apply to AIs.
Here, we claim that AIs are likely to meet all three conditions, so we
should expect natural selection forces to influence their traits and
development.</p>
<p><strong>Variation: AIs are designed and trained in a variety of
ways.</strong> As previously noted in "Natural Selection Favors AI over
Humans" <span class="citation"
data-cites="hendrycks2023natural">[9]</span>,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"When thinking about advanced AI, some have envisioned a single AI
that is nearly omniscient and nearly omnipotent, escaping the lab and
suddenly controlling the world. This scenario tends to assume a rapid,
almost overnight, take-off with no prior proliferation of other AI
agents; we would go from AIs roughly similar to the ones we have now to
an AI that has capabilities we can hardly imagine so quickly that we
barely notice anything is changing. However, there could also be many
useful AIs, as is the case now. It is more reasonable to assume that AI
agents would progressively proliferate and become increasingly competent
at specific tasks, rather than assume one AI agent spontaneously goes
from incompetent to omnicompetent. This is similar to the subdivision of
biological niches. For example, lions and cheetahs developed completely
different and mutually exclusive strategies to catch prey through
strength or speed. Furthermore, if there are multiple AIs, they can work
in parallel rather than waiting for a single model to get around to a
task, making things move much faster." <span class="citation"
data-cites="hendrycks2023natural">[9]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This means that people are likely to continue creating multiple AI
agents, even if there is a single best model. Financial gains would
encourage multiple competitors to challenge the top system <span
class="citation" data-cites="dietterich2000ensemble">[10]</span>.<p>
In addition to the argument that AI populations have variation because
of the history of their development, there are also pragmatic arguments
for this claim. In evolutionary theory, Fisher’s fundamental theorem
states that the rate of adaptation is directly proportional to the
variation (all else equal). In rapidly-changing environments, where
quick adaptation increases a population’s probability of survival,
populations with more variation may persist longer. Consider how
variation in crops reduces the probability of catastrophic crop failure,
and variation in investments reduces the risk of unmanageable financial
losses. And in machine learning, an ensemble of AI systems will often
perform more accurately than a single AI <span class="citation"
data-cites="dietterich2000ensemble">[10]</span>. Variation can help
guide decision making, in the same way that many people’s aggregated
predictions will usually be better than any one expert’s. Because of
these factors, we are more likely to see a powerful and resilient
population of AIs if they have significant variation.</p>
<p><strong>Variation in AI developers.</strong> As well as variation in
the AI systems themselves, we also see variation between the big
technology companies developing and adopting AI technologies. It may
seem simple to prevent the rise of selfish AI behaviors by avoiding
their selection. However, the reality is different. AI companies,
directed more by evolutionary pressures than by safety concerns, are
vying for survival in a fiercely competitive landscape. Consider how
OpenAI, which started as a nonprofit dedicated to benefiting humanity,
shifted to a capped-profit structure in 2019 due to funding needs.
Consequently, some of its safety-centric members branched out and
founded Anthropic, a company intending to prioritize AI safety. However,
even Anthropic couldn’t resist the call of commercialization, succumbing
to evolutionary pressures itself.<p>
Evolutionary pressures are driving safety-minded researchers to adopt
the behaviors of their less safety-minded competitors, because they are
anticipating that they can gain a significant fitness advantage in the
short-term by deprioritizing safety. Note that this evolutionary process
is not based on actual selection events (the researchers will not be
destroyed if they are outcompeted), but rather the researchers’
projections of what might happen if they adopt particular strategies. AI
safety <em>ideas</em> are being selected against, which is driving the
researchers to change their <em>behavior</em> (to behave in a less
safety-conscious manner). Importantly, as the number of competitors
rises, the variation in approaches and values also increases. This
increase in variation escalates the intensity of the evolutionary
pressures and the extent to which these pressures distort the behavior
of big AI companies.</p>
<p><strong>Retention: new AIs are developed under the influence of
earlier generations.</strong> Retention does not require exact copying;
it only requires that there be non-zero similarity among individuals in
subsequent generations. In the short term, AIs are developed by adapting
older models, or by imitating features from competitors’ models. Even
when training AIs from scratch, retention may still occur, as highly
effective architectures, datasets, and training environments are reused
thereby shaping the agent in a way similar to how humans (or other
biological species) are shaped by their environments. Even if AIs change
very rapidly compared to the timescales of biological evolution, they
will still meet the criterion of retention; their generations can be
extremely short, so they can move through many generations in a short
time, but each generation will still be similar to the one before it.
Retention is a very easy standard to meet, and even with many
uncertainties about what AIs may be like, it is very likely that they
meet this broad definition.</p>
<p><strong>Differential Fitness: some AIs are propagated more than
others.</strong> There are many traits which could cause some AI models
or traits to be propagated more than others (increasing their
“fitness”). Some of these traits could be highly undesirable to humans.
For example, <em>being safer</em> than alternatives may confer a fitness
advantage to an AI. However, <em>merely appearing to be safer</em> might
also improve an AI’s fitness. Similarly, <em>being good at automating
human jobs</em> could result in an AI being propagated more. On the
other hand, <em>being easy to deactivate</em> could reduce an AI’s
fitness. Therefore, an AI might increase its fitness by integrating
itself into critical infrastructure or encouraging humans to develop a
dependency for it, making us less keen to deactivate it. As long as some
AIs are at least marginally more attractive than others, AI populations
will meet the condition of differential fitness. There are many possible
points at which natural selection could take effect on AIs. These
include the actions of AI developers, in fine-tuning and customizing
models, or re-designing training processes.</p>
<p><strong>If the Lewontin conditions are satisfied, we must consider
how intense the evolutionary pressures are.</strong> More intense
selection pressure leads to faster change. In a population of birds in a
time with plenty of food, birds with any shape beak may survive.
However, if food becomes scarce, only those with the most efficient
beaks for accessing some specific food may survive, and the next
generation will disproportionately have that beak shape. More variation
also leads to faster adaptation, because variants that will be adaptive
in a new circumstance are more likely to already exist in the
population. The faster rounds of adaptation occur, the more quickly
distinct groups emerge with their own features.<p>
If there is more intense selection pressure on AIs, where only AIs with
certain traits propagate, then we should expect to see the population
optimize around those traits. If there is more variation in the AI
population, that optimization process will be faster. If the rate of
adaptation also accelerates, we would expect trends that lead to greater
differentiation in AI populations that are distinct from the changes in
the traits of individual AI models. In the following section, we will
discuss the evolutionary trends that tend to dominate when selection
pressure is intense and how they might shape AI populations.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We started this section by exploring how evolution by natural
selection can occur in non-biological contexts. We then formalized this
idea of “generalized Darwinism” using Lewontin’s conditions and the
Price equation. We found that AI development may be subject to
evolutionary pressures by evaluating how it meets the Lewontin
conditions. In the next section, we turn to the ramifications of this
claim.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:selection-and-selfish">7.3.5 Levels of Selection and Selfish
Behavior</h2>
<p>Our aim in this section is to understand which AI characteristics are
favored by natural selection. We explore this by first outlining an
“information’s eye view” of evolution by natural selection. Here, we
find that internal conflict can arise where the interests of the
propagating information (such as a gene) clash with those of the larger
entity that contains it (such as an organism). This phenomenon could
arise in AI systems, distorting or subverting goals even when human
operators have specified them correctly.<p>
We then move to a second risk generated by natural selection operating
at the level of propagating information: Darwinian forces strongly favor
selfish traits over altruistic ones. Although on the level of an
individual organism, individuals may behave altruistically under
specific conditions (such as genetic relatedness), on the level of
information, evolution by natural selection tends to produce
selfishness. We conclude by outlining how a multi-agent AI future shaped
by natural selection will be dominated by selfish behavior.</p>
<h3 id="informations-eye-view">Information’s Eye View</h3>
<p>We often consider individual organisms to be the unit on which
natural selection is operating. However, it is their genes that are
being propagated through time and space, not the organisms themselves.
This section considers the “gene’s eye view” of evolution by natural
selection. We then use generalized Darwinism to build up an extrapolated
version of this perspective we can call the “information’s eye view” of
evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Species succeed when their information propagates, but
sometimes interests diverge.</strong> The information of living
organisms is primarily contained in DNA. Genes contain the instructions
for forming bodies. Most of the time, a gene propagates most
successfully when the organism that contains it propagates successfully.
But sometimes, the best thing for a gene is not the best thing for the
organism. For example, mitochondrial DNA is only passed on from females,
so it propagates most if the organism has only female offspring. In some
organisms, mitochondrial DNA gives rise to genetic mechanisms that
increase the production of female descendants. However, if too many
individuals have this mutation, the population will be
disproportionately female, and the organism will be unable to pass on
the rest of its genes. In this situation, the most effective propagation
mechanisms for the gene in the mitochondria is harmful to the
reproductive success of its host.</p>
<p><strong>The “gene’s eye view” of evolution.</strong> In <em>The
Selfish Gene</em>, Richard Dawkins argues that <em>gene</em> propagation
is a more useful framing than organism propagation <span
class="citation" data-cites="dawkins2006selfish">[4]</span>. In Dawkins’
view, organisms are simply vehicles that allow genes to propagate.
Instead of thinking of birds with long beaks competing with birds with
short beaks, we can think about genes that create long beaks competing
with genes that create short beaks, in a fight for space within the bird
population. This gives us a framework for understanding examples like
the one above: the gene within the mitochondria is competing for space
in the population, and will sometimes take that space even at the
expense of the host’s individual fitness.</p>
<p><strong>Information functions similarly to genes, narrowing the space
of possibilities.</strong> We are humans and not dogs, roundworms, or
redwood trees almost entirely because of our genes. If we do not know
anything about what an organism is, aside from how long its genome is,
then for every base in the genome, there are four possibilities, so
there is an extremely large number of possible combinations. If we learn
that the first base is a G, you have divided the total number by four.
When we decode the entire genome, we have narrowed down an impossibly
large space of possibility to a single one: we can now know not only
that the organism is a cat, but even <em>which</em> cat
specifically.<p>
In non-biological systems, information works in a parallel way. There
are many possible ways to begin a sentence. Each word eliminates
possible endings and decreases the listener’s uncertainty, until they
know the full sentence at the end. Using the framework of information
theory, we can think of information as the resolution or reduction of
uncertainty (though this is not a formal definition). For an idea,
information is just the facts about it that make it different from other
ideas. A textbook’s main information is its text. A song’s information
consists of the pitches and rhythms that distinguish it from other
songs. These larger phenomena (ideas, books, songs) are distinguished by
the information they contain.</p>
<p><strong>Information that propagates occupies a larger volume of both
time and space.</strong> A single music score, written centuries ago and
buried underground ever since, has been propagated across hundreds of
years of time, but very little space. In contrast, a hit tune that is
suddenly everywhere and then quickly forgotten takes up a lot of space,
but very little time. But the best propagated information takes up a
large volume of both. The tune for “Twinkle Twinkle” has been taking up
space in many minds, pieces of paper, and digital formats for hundreds
of years and continues to propagate. The same is true for genetic
information. A gene that flourished briefly hundreds of millions of
years ago, and one that has had a consistent small presence, both take
up much less space-time volume than a gene that long ago became dominant
in many successful branches of the evolutionary tree <span
class="citation" data-cites="Smolin1992DidTU">[2]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Just as some genes propagate more, the same is true for bits
of information.</strong> In accordance with generalized Darwinism, we
can extend the gene’s eye view to an “information’s eye view.” A living
organism’s basic unit of information is a gene. Everything that evolves
as a consequence of Darwinian forces contains information, some of which
is inherited more than others. Dawkins coined the term “meme” as an
analogue for gene: a meme is the basic unit of cultural inheritance.
Like genes, memes tend to develop variations, and be copied and adapted
into new iterations. The philosopher of science, Karl Popper, wrote that
the growth of knowledge is “the natural selection of hypotheses: our
knowledge consists, at every moment, of those hypotheses which have
shown their (comparative) fitness by surviving so far in their struggle
for existence.” Social phenomena such as copycat crimes can also be
modeled as examples of memetic inheritance. Many types of crimes are
committed daily, some of which inspire imitators, whose subsequent
crimes can themselves be selected for and copied. Selection operates on
the level of individual pieces of information, as well as on the higher
level of organisms and phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>AIs may pass on information in ways analogous to our genetics
and cultural memetics.</strong> AIs are computer programs, made of code
that determines what they are like, in a similar way to how our DNA
determines what we are like. Different code makes the difference between
an agentic AI and Flappy Bird. Their code, or pieces from it, can be
directly copied and adapted for new models. But their information can
also be memetically transmitted, as our cultural memes can. Even today,
AIs are often designed based on hearing about and imitating successful
models, not only on copying code from them. AIs also help create
training data for new AIs and evaluate their learning, which makes the
new AIs tend to have traits similar to earlier models. As AIs continue
to become more autonomous, they may be able to imitate and learn from
one another, self-modifying to adopt traits and behaviors that seem
useful. The AI information that propagates the most will take up more
and more space-time volume, as it is copied into more AIs that multiply
and endure over longer periods.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:intrasys-goal">7.3.6 Intrasystem Goal Conflict</h2>
<p>The interests of an organism and its genetic information are usually
aligned well. However, they can sometimes diverge from one another. In
this section, we identify analogous, non-biological phenomena, where
conflict arises between a system and the sub-systems in which it stores
its information. Evolutionary pressures might generate internal conflict
within AI systems. This could distort or subvert goals set for AIs by
human operators, even when the goal was specified and understood
correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict within genomes.</strong> As we have seen, selection
on the level of genes does not always result in the best outcomes for
the organism. As briefly mentioned above, human mitochondrial DNA is
only transferred to offspring through biological females. A human’s
mitochondrial genome is identical to their biological mother’s, assuming
no change due to mutation. Thus, mitochondrial genes which benefit only
females may be selected for, even where they incur a cost upon males, as
males represent a heritability deadend. These and other “selfish”
genetic elements give rise to intragenomic conflict.<p>

<p><strong>Conflict within organisms.</strong> We observe other kinds of
internal conflict within organisms which do not concern their genomes.
For example, the bacterial species that compose the human gut microbiome
can exist in a mutually-beneficial symbiosis with their host. However,
some bacteria reveal themselves to be “opportunistically pathogenic”: in
the wake of disruptions like the use of antibiotics, many of these
once-mutualists will propagate at accelerated rates, often at the
expense of the host’s health. As the philosopher of evolutionary biology
Samir Okasha notes, “intraorganismic conflict is relatively common among
modern organisms”. <span class="citation" data-cites="Okasha2018AgentsAG">[13]</span>>
<p>
<strong>Conflict within an AI company.</strong> The concept of 
intrasystem conflict extends beyond biological examples and can be observed
 in organizations. A notable example is OpenAI. In 2017, there was a power 
struggle in OpenAI, which led to Elon Musk's exit and Sam Altman becoming 
OpenAI's main leader. In 2020, disagreements within OpenAI led to the departure 
of some employees to found Anthropic. In 2023, the board of the nonprofit 
overseeing OpenAI came into conflict with Sam Altman and attempted to fire him as CEO.
Challenging-to-resolve disagreements about who should influence AI's development 
make intrasystem conflict at AI organizations likely in the future.
.</p>
<p><strong>Intrasystem goal conflict: between information and the larger
entity that contains it.</strong> Just as in the case of intraorganismic
conflict, the interests of propagating information and the entities that
contain the information can diverge from one another. We call the more general phenomenon that can describe all of
these examples <em>intrasystem goal conflict</em>: the clash of
interests of different agents within a shared system. As we have seen, intrasystem goal
conflict can arise within complex systems in a range of domains,
from genomes to corporations.</p>

<p><strong>Intrasystem goal conflict in AI systems.</strong> In the
future, humans and AI agents may interact in many different ways,
including by working together on collaborative projects. This provides
the opportunity for goal distortion or subordination through intrasystem
goal conflict. For instance, when humans enlist AI agents to collaborate
on tasks, principal-agent problems may arise. Just as how human
collaborators may betray or overturn their principals, AI agents may
behave similarly. If an AI collaborator has a goal of self-preservation,
they may try to remove any leverage or power others have over them. In
this way, the system (of principal and agent) that ends up executing
actions based on these conflicting goals will not necessarily be
equivalent to how a system with unity of purpose would pursue the goal
set by the humans. The behavior of this emergent multi-agent system may
thus distort our goals, or even subvert them altogether.</p>
<h2 id="selfishness">7.3.7 Selfishness</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we examined one risk generated by natural
selection favoring the propagation of information: conflict between the
information (such as genes, departments, or sub-agents) and the larger
entity that contains it (such as an organism, government, or AI system).
In this section, we consider a second risk: that natural selection tends
to favor selfish traits and strategies over altruistic ones. We conclude
that the greater the influence of evolutionary pressures on AI
development, the more we should expect a multi-AI agent future to be one
dominated by selfish behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Selfishness: furthering one’s own information propagation at
the expense of others.</strong> In evolutionary theory, “selfishness”
does not imply intent to harm another, or belief that one’s own
interests ought to dominate. Organisms that do not have malicious
intentions often display selfish traits. The lancet liver fluke, for
example, is a small parasite that infects sheep by first infecting ants,
hijacking their brains and making them climb to the top of stalks of
grass, where they get eaten by sheep <span class="citation"
data-cites="martin20183d">[17]</span>. The lancet liver fluke does not
wish ants ill, nor does it have a belief that lancet liver flukes should
thrive while ants should get eaten. It simply has evolved a behavior
that enables it to propagate its own information at the expense of the
ant’s.</p>
<p><strong>Selfishness in AI.</strong> AI systems may exhibit “selfish”
behaviors, expanding the AIs’ influence at the expense of human values.
Note that these AIs may not even understand what a human is and yet
still behave selfishly towards them. For example, AIs may automate human
tasks, necessitating extensive layoffs <span class="citation"
data-cites="hendrycks2023overview">[18]</span>. This could be very
detrimental to humans, by generating rapid or widespread unemployment.
However, it could take place without any malicious intent on the part of
AIs merely behaving in accordance with their pursuit of efficiency. AIs
may also develop newer AIs that are more advanced but less
interpretable, reducing human oversight. Additionally, some AIs may
leverage emotional connections by imitating sentience or emulating the
loved ones of human users. This might generate social resistance to
their deactivation. For instance, AIs that plead not to be deactivated
might stimulate an emotional attachment in some humans. If afforded
legal rights, these AIs might adapt and evolve outside human control,
becoming deeply embedded in society and expanding their influence in
ways that could be irreversible.</p>
<p><strong>Selfish traits are not the opposite of cooperation.</strong>
Many organisms display cooperative behavior at the individual level.
Chimpanzees, for example, regularly groom other members of their group.
They don’t do this to be “nice,” but rather because this behavior is
reciprocated in future, so they are likely to eventually benefit from it
themselves <span class="citation"
data-cites="schino2007grooming">[19]</span>. Cells found in filamentous
bacteria, so named because they form chains, regularly kill themselves
to provide much needed nitrogen for the communal thread of bacterial
life, with every tenth cell or so “committing suicide” <span
class="citation" data-cites="ratzke2017ecological">[20]</span>. But even
in these examples, cooperative behavior ultimately helps the
individual’s information propagate. Chimpanzees who groom others expect
to have the favor returned in future. Filamentous bacteria live in
colonies made up of their clones, so one bacterium sacrificing itself to
save copies of itself still propagates its information. We cover this in
more detail in the next section: <em>Conflict and Cooperation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Natural selection tends to produce selfish traits.</strong>
Organisms that further their own information propagation will typically
propagate more. A lancet liver fluke that developed the ability to give
ants free choice and allow them not to climb stalks of grass if they
don’t want to would be less likely than the current version to succeed
at getting eaten by sheep and continuing its life cycle. Most biological
selfishness is less dramatic, but nonetheless, the organisms alive today
are necessarily the descendants of those that succeeded at propagating
their own information, and not of those that traded propagation for
other qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Altruism that reduces an individual’s fitness is not an
evolutionarily stable strategy.</strong> Imagine a very altruistic
fictional population of foxes who freely share food with one another,
even at great cost to themselves. When food is abundant, they all
thrive, and when food is scarce, they suffer together. If, during a time
of scarcity, one fox decides to steal food from the communal stores and
take it for herself and her offspring, they may survive while others
starve. As a result, her offspring, who may have inherited her selfish
trait, will make up a higher proportion of the next generation. As this
repeats, the population will be dominated by individuals who take food
for themselves when they can. The population of altruists may get along
quite well on its own, but altruism is unstable, because anyone who
decides to exploit it will do better than the group. Since altruism that
reduces an individual’s overall fitness is not an evolutionarily stable
strategy, we should expect to see selfish behavior being promoted.</p>
<p><strong>The more natural selection acts on a population, the more
selfish behavior we expect.</strong> In the example in the preceding
paragraph, when food is abundant, there is little advantage to
selfishness and there may even be penalties, as the group punishes
selfish behavior. There is plenty of food to go around, so the
descendants of foxes who steal food will not be much more likely to
survive, and the next generation can contain plenty of altruists. But in
times when only a few can propagate, selfishness will confer a greater
advantage, and the population will tend to become selfish more
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding extreme AI selfishness: changing the
environment.</strong> AI agents’ fitness could either be influenced more
by natural selection or by the environment. We have sketched out the
default outcome of the former: a landscape of powerful and selfish AI
agents. One way we might prevent this trend towards increasingly selfish
behavior is to ensure that it is the <em>environment</em> which ends up
shaping the fitness of AI agents substantially more than natural
selection. Currently, we are in an environment of extreme competition,
and so AI agents that are better-suited to this competitive environment
will propagate more, and increase the proportion of the population with
their traits (including selfish traits). However, if we altered the
environment such that the actions of AI researchers and AI agents were
not so heavily steered by competitive pressures, we could reduce this
problem.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding extreme AI selfishness: changing the
selection.</strong> Another possibility is to change what makes AI
agents “fit.” We could establish an ecosystem in which AI agents can be
developed, deployed, and adopted more safely, without the influence of
such extreme competitive pressures. In this ecosystem, we could select
against AIs with the most harmful selfish behaviors, and select for AIs
that faithfully assist humans. As these AIs proliferate through this
ecosystem, they could then counteract the worst excesses of selfish
behavior from other agents.</p>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>In this section, we considered the effects of evolutionary pressures
on AI populations. We started by using the idea of generalized Darwinism
to expand the “gene’s eye view” of biological evolution to an
“information’s eye view.” Using this view, we identified two AI risks
generated by natural selection: intrasystem goal conflict and selfish
behavior. Intrasystem goal conflict could distort or subvert the goals
we set an AI system to pursue. Selfish behavior would likely be favored
by natural selection wherever it promotes the propagation of
information: If AI development is subject to strong Darwinian forces, we
should expect AIs to tend towards selfish behaviors.<p>
