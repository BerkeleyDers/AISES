<h4
id="what-if-we-allow-the-economy-to-decide-what-ais-will-be-like">What
if we allow the economy to decide what AIs will be like?</h4>
<p>Most AI systems today are being developed by businesses. We could
therefore argue that AI development is most closely aligned to business,
or economic, goals like wealth maximization, as opposed to improvements
in social wellbeing. Many argue that AIs should maximize economic
measures like wealth or GDP. It is also increasingly likely that AIs
will transform the economy by enabling new forms of business, changing
the nature of work, and even displacing human workers. In this section,
we will examine whether AIs shaped by economic incentives create the
sort of society most people want. We examine both how the economy shapes
the development of AI, and how AI might impact the economy.</p>
<h4
id="business-goals-influence-the-development-of-the-most-capable-ai-systems.">Business
goals influence the development of the most capable AI systems.</h4>
<p>AIs are increasingly more efficient than humans at tasks once
considered difficult to automate. In the customer service industry, for
example, many businesses rely on chatbots instead of human
representatives. Chatbots reduce expenses and streamline operations,
ultimately increasing profits. The current trend towards automation
suggests that many of the most powerful AI systems will be deployed to
serve specific business objectives.<p>
Whether this is a reason for optimism or concern depends on to what
extent we think that the economy, left to its own devices, will produce
good outcomes. On one hand, AI has the potential to enhance efficiency
and foster competition, which can lower consumer costs and spur the
creation of innovative products. However, business-oriented AIs may
focus narrowly on achieving their specific goals, compromising values
such as community, personal freedom, privacy, and consumer choice. We
can draw from economics to examine how AI usage in business contexts
could either support or disrupt societal wellbeing.</p>
<h4 id="using-ai-to-maximize-profits-creates-wealth.">Using AI to
maximize profits creates wealth.</h4>
<p>In a market system, businesses often prioritize maximizing profits
because the primary responsibility of company executives is to increase
value for shareholders. This concept, called shareholder primacy, has
been codified both implicitly and explicitly into American corporate law
<span class="citation" data-cites="lipton2019shareholder">[1]</span>. In
theory, corporations that explicitly prioritize other values such as
safety or social responsibility above profit in the long run can be sued
for neglecting their obligation to maximize shareholder value. This
profit—centered approach means that—without effective directed state
intervention—most AI systems will not first and foremost be used to help
us create a society that satisfies broader human values.<p>
Consider recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms. These AI
systems are designed to keep us engaged for as long as possible, thereby
increasing ad revenue and profit for the platform. Since these
algorithms prioritize viewer engagement over everything else, they may
recommend content that fuels addiction or spreads misinformation. In
other words, while these algorithms may be effective from a business
standpoint, they may have negative impacts on individuals and society at
large. While wealth creation is generally good, there are serious
implications of prioritizing profit over all other values.</p>
<h4 id="the-economy-is-the-backbone-of-our-daily-lives.">The economy is
the backbone of our daily lives.</h4>
<p>The economy is not just a network of businesses and transactions: it
touches every aspect of our lives. Every transaction, small or large
that we make, is impacted by economic factors. At a highly simplified
level, the economy determines the <em>prices</em> of goods and services
and the <em>incomes</em> earned by workers. Consider how these two
factors affect the decision to make a large purchase, such as a house.
The price of a house (most often paid as a mortgage) is shaped by
interest rates, as well as the level of competition to buy and sell
houses. A person’s income determines their ability to make the purchase,
and is influenced by economic forces like labor markets and company
profits.<p>
As businesses continue to leverage AI for economic gain, these systems
become ingrained in our economic fabric. For example, AI is increasingly
used by banks to assess credit risk and decide who gets approved for a
loan. If this practice becomes more prevalent, AI will no longer be just
a tool; it will determine who can buy a house or run a business. The
advance of AI in business affects everyone’s life at a basic level. The
use of AI may lead to improvements, such as lower prices, or challenges,
like widespread job losses due to automation, that impact us
fundamentally.</p>
<h4 id="technology-changes-the-economy-and-the-world.">Technology
changes the economy and the world.</h4>
<p>Throughout history, technology has been a pivotal driver of economic
change. Consider the first agricultural revolution. The invention of
farming tools and techniques transformed societies from hunter-gatherers
to settled agricultural communities, fundamentally altering the economy
and human lifestyle. Fast-forward to the mid-1700s, when the steam
engine drove the industrial revolution, sparking rapid economic growth
and urbanization and shifting the economy from primarily agrarian to
primarily industrial. Factories became the economic focal point,
creating jobs and spurring the development of new sectors like rail and
shipping. More recently, the internet and smartphones have connected
billions of people, breaking down geographical barriers and enabling new
types of businesses like e-commerce and remote work.</p>
<h4
id="artificial-intelligence-might-be-the-next-transformative-technology.">Artificial
intelligence might be the next transformative technology.</h4>
<p>As AI becomes increasingly critical for businesses, consumers, and
governance, it may alter daily life, from work and education to
interpersonal relationships and entertainment. As it evolves and
permeates more sectors, its economic and societal effects of the AI
revolution could be as transformative as those of the agricultural or
industrial revolutions <span class="citation"
data-cites="pwc2017sizing">[2]</span>. Therefore, understanding AI’s
potential risks and benefits is essential for navigating this new
economic landscape.</p>
<h4 id="preview.">Preview.</h4>
<p>In this section, we discuss how economics and AI interact, using both
theoretical models of economies that make strong, idealized assumptions
and empirical data collected from real-world economies. In many places,
we will introduce and explain basic concepts from economics, such as
gains from trade and how growth benefits society. This background
content is an essential foundation for discussing the dramatic impact
that AI systems might have on our societies. For those already familiar
with economic theory, it serves as a reminder and an explanation of how
these concepts can be relevant to AI. We use these tools to address
questions around AI’s economic effects. For example, to what extent
should we expect AI to prove beneficial (for example due to efficiency
gains) or harmful (due to inequality and market failures). Will the
benefits of AI systems mostly accrue in the form of wealth increases for
their owners, or will they also increase social wellbeing and happiness
in general? Throughout, we will examine how economic incentives can
influence the development of AI systems, and thus shape their impact on
society.</p>
<h2 id="the-free-market">6.4.1 The Free Market</h2>
<p>Under ideal circumstances, competitive economic markets drive
efficiency and foster collective prosperity. One can speculate that the
integration of AI into the economic engine could further optimize
efficiency and enhance competition, ultimately contributing to
accelerated economic growth and improved wellbeing. In this subsection,
we will revisit introductory concepts from economics to examine the case
that AIs (developed in accordance with market incentives) can create
widespread benefits by improving efficiency and growth.<p>
</p>
<div class="visionbox">
<legend class="visionboxlegend">
    <p><span><b>A Note on Gains from Trade</b></span></p>
</legend>
<strong>We can specialize and
trade, making everyone better off.</strong> Trade is often seen as a
win-win scenario, allowing for mutual benefit. Take a simple scenario.
Suppose Alice and Bob are stranded on an island. Each of them has one
skill: Alice is excellent at gathering coconuts for water, while Bob is
especially good at catching fish to eat. Suppose that, left to their own
devices, Alice would struggle to have food to eat, and Bob would
struggle to have coconut water to drink. However, if Alice and Bob agree
to specialize in their respective skills and then trade, they can both
focus on doing what they are good at, wasting less time on individually
unproductive activities and therefore producing more food in total, and
each ending up with more food and drink than if they had worked
alone.<p>
Moreover, even if Alice is better than Bob at both gathering coconuts
and catching fish, they will still benefit from specialization. Suppose
Bob is better at fishing than he is at gathering coconuts. Even though
he’s not as good as Alice at either, they’ll still produce more overall
if Alice focuses on coconuts and Bob on fishing. In most cases, trading
makes people better off. One role of the economy is to enable such
trades on a large scale.</p>
</div>
<h4
id="markets-coordinate-trade-allowing-gains-from-specialization.">Markets
coordinate trade, allowing gains from specialization.</h4>
<p>A market is a venue for trade, a system that enables the exchange of
goods and services. It can be a physical location or through any other
matching mechanism like e-commerce platforms. Markets allow everyone to
benefit from high levels of specialization and reap the benefits of
trade. In the global marketplace, few people have to farm their own
food, build their own houses, and make their own clothes, because
everyone trades their time and skills for goods and services created by
others. Markets can be thought of as a grand collaboration, facilitating
cooperation among millions of people across the globe.</p>
<h4
id="markets-encourage-a-complex-blend-of-competition-and-collaboration.">Markets
encourage a complex blend of competition and collaboration.</h4>
<p>Companies like Toyota and Ford compete to sell their cars to
consumers. However, they also often collaborate on research and
development projects. This cooperation can result in advancements like
more efficient engines or safer car designs, benefiting both companies
and their customers. In general, while firms within the same industry
compete against each other for market share, they also cooperate with
strategic partners, suppliers, and vendors for mutual benefit.
Cooperation helps companies optimize resources and improve products or
services while competition drives innovation and offers consumers more
choices.</p>
<h4
id="prices-enable-the-economy-to-be-an-adaptable-self-organizing-complex-system.">Prices
enable the economy to be an adaptable, self-organizing complex
system.</h4>
<p>Prices in a market economy are signals of changing demand and supply,
created by individual agents acting in accordance with their incentives.
As an example, let’s trace how the high oil prices in the 1970s
reorganized the global flower market. In 1971, the price of oil
increased dramatically, signaling that oil had become more scarce. This
price signal gave individuals and businesses an incentive to find ways
to reduce spending on oil or develop substitutes. The higher cost of
heating greenhouses using oil led to flower suppliers reducing their
production, causing the price of roses and other flowers to increase. In
turn, consumers turned to substitutes like chocolate and teddy bears for
Valentine’s Day gifts. In the meantime, opportunistic entrepreneurs
began thinking of alternative, cheaper ways to produce flowers. They
encouraged farmers in Kenya and Ecuador to grow roses using natural
heat, and invested in a global infrastructure to deliver roses
worldwide; as a result, they started using land for roses instead of
coffee, which saw an increase in the price of coffee.<p>
In these cases information in the market, primarily transmitted through
prices, efficiently coordinated the actions of individuals and
businesses, allowing them to use their own knowledge and ingenuity to
make optimal business decisions in a way that no individual or
government would be able to do. The production of oil, flowers,
chocolates, teddy bears, coffee, and many other goods was adjusted in
order to create and deliver the most value possible given the available
resources and information.</p>
<h4
id="ais-developed-by-actors-in-a-free-market-can-create-widespread-benefits.">AIs
developed by actors in a free market can create widespread
benefits.</h4>
<p>Market forces create incentives for entrepreneurs and firms to
rapidly develop a wide range of services that use AIs to meet the needs
of many different types of consumers. In the wake of the release of
early LLMs, for instance, hundreds of startups were created to improve
consumers’ ability to achieve a range of tasks. AlphaFold’s public
release accelerated research in biology and biotechnology. These
leveraged the entrepreneurial spirit and capacity for innovation of many
people around the world. Many people are concerned that regulating this
process could stop breakthroughs in accelerating economic growth or
extending human lifespans.</p>
<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>
<p><em>AIs can increase allocative efficiency, ensuring that outcomes
are efficient and contribute to social welfare.</em></p>
<h4 id="the-free-market-creates-allocative-efficiency.">The free market
creates allocative efficiency.</h4>
<p>The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics states
that—subject to some strong assumptions—an equilibrium
<em>allocation</em> of goods reached by trading on a free market must be
<em>Pareto efficient</em>. An outcome is Pareto efficient if there is no
way to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off: any
change must trade off one person’s welfare against another. If the
allocation of goods were not Pareto efficient, then individuals within
it would trade in a way that exploited the possible Pareto improvement,
reaching a state in which no mutually beneficial trades can be
made.<p>
This supports Adam Smith’s famous “Invisible Hand” argument, which
suggests that when individuals pursue their self-interest within a
market, they unintentionally contribute to societal welfare. By creating
gains from trade, there is an overall improvement in living standards
for everyone.</p>
<h4
id="there-are-many-conditions-required-for-the-invisible-hand-argument-to-hold.">There
are many conditions required for the invisible hand argument to
hold.</h4>
<p>Without the following conditions, the invisible hand argument—which
holds that the presence of free markets with individuals acting in
self-interest can create outcomes that are Pareto efficient—would
fail.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>There must be an open market.</strong> There should be no
barriers to entry for producers or buyers, so that everyone can
participate in this market. This openness stimulates competition,
promoting economic efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There should be no seller big enough to move prices up
alone.</strong> If there are many sellers, then anyone who raises prices
will lose consumers. There must be no monopoly power: anyone with the
ability to raise prices without being forced down by competition will
create distortions that leave consumers worse off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No producer should privately hold a pivotal
technology.</strong> This means that other producers should be able to
copy the production of the first-mover. While the first-mover will make
profits in the short run, in the long run the market allocation will be
Pareto optimal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buyer should be big enough to move prices down
alone.</strong> Similar to the condition for producers, no buyer should
be big enough to force producers to take lower prices than others would
offer for them. Such buyers would create distortions that might, for
instance, force producers out of business, ultimately harming
everyone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There must be perfect information for everyone.</strong>
Producers and consumers must have access to perfect information, such as
about product quality and pricing. If consumers don’t know, for
instance, that a seller’s product is defective or that other sellers are
offering lower prices, then markets cannot achieve efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preferences must be non-satiated.</strong> The first
welfare theorem does not hold for all types of preferences; one
technical restriction is that consumers should always prefer more of a
good. If someone gains no further value from extra consumption, their
trading equilibria may not be Pareto efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There must be no externalities in consumption.</strong>
When one consumes a good, there must be no effect—positive or
negative—on anyone else. Second-hand smoke has a negative externality on
anyone nearby but this is unaccounted for in the price of cigarettes,
creating inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The state enforces property and contract laws.</strong>
Most economic theory assumes that contracts are enforceable, and that
individuals and corporations have protected property rights. Without
these, trading would be difficult to achieve and much more costly,
making it more difficult for everyone to achieve optimal
outcomes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the conditions for the invisible hand theorem always held, then we
might be more optimistic about AI’s role in enhancing social welfare. If
companies use AI to boost productive efficiency, lower costs, and
improve products, then these actions should eventually translate into
widespread advantages. Lower prices, improved products, and better
services could enhance consumer wellbeing, while increased efficiency
could stimulate economic growth. Later in this section, we will look at
market failures and inequality: two reasons why free trade is
insufficient to create social welfare. For now, we will focus on the
benefits.</p>
<h4
id="competition-fosters-productive-efficiency-and-growth.">Competition
fosters productive efficiency and growth.</h4>
<p>Markets continuously incentivize the lowering of prices and the
improvement of quality. Let’s imagine two grocery stores in a town. If
one store starts to offer lower prices, customers may flock to that
store, putting pressure on the other store to match those prices or risk
losing business. This encourages firms to be more <em>productively
efficient</em>–—to produce goods at lower costs–—so that they can lower
their prices while still making a profit. This competition can lead to
lower prices or higher quality products for consumers and more
attractive employment options for workers.<p>
By leveraging AI, businesses can become more competitive by increasing
their productive efficiency. For example, many companies now use
AI-driven chatbots to handle customer service inquiries. These chatbots
can manage numerous queries simultaneously, around the clock, and
without human error, reducing the need for large customer service teams
and significantly reducing costs. AI can automate tasks that were
traditionally labor-intensive, leading to considerable savings.
Furthermore, AI can enhance decision-making processes. For instance,
companies can use AI to analyze large volumes of data and generate
insights about market trends, customer preferences, and operational
efficiencies. Such insights can inform strategic decisions, providing a
competitive advantage.<p>
Given the extensive benefits of AI, its adoption by businesses is likely
to continue to grow. Firms that do not leverage AI may find themselves
at a disadvantage, struggling to keep up with competitors that have
harnessed the power of AI to optimize their operations and enhance their
offerings. In the competitive business world, the ability to adapt and
adopt new technologies like AI is not merely an option–—it’s essential
for survival.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p><em>AIs have the potential to drive economic growth, which can make
everyone better off without compromising value pluralism and improve
society across correlated domains like health, freedom, and
education.</em></p>
<h4
id="growth-is-widely-considered-essential-to-a-healthy-society.">Growth
is widely considered essential to a healthy society.</h4>
<p>Economic growth is an increase in the total value of the production
of goods and services. Such growth is a vital sign of a thriving
economy. An expanding economy usually indicates more wealth,
opportunities, and advancements, leading to overall improvements in
living standards. Growth plays a key role in sparking innovation and
entrepreneurship by creating incentives for companies to invest in ways
to accelerate production and additional funding available for research
and development. Growth encourages the creation of new ventures,
products, and ideas.<p>
Economic growth typically brings about improved employment opportunities
and better consumer products. A growing economy fosters job creation,
providing more people with income and stability; for example, the tech
industry’s growth led to a boom in job opportunities in fields like
software development, data analysis, and AI research. As companies grow
and industries expand, businesses can invest more in research and
development, leading to new and improved products; for instance, the
smartphone industry’s growth has led to a variety of advanced phones
with innovative features that have given billions of people access to
the global economy. We generally consider economic growth desirable
because it means we get wealthier over time.</p>
<h4 id="growth-might-let-us-promote-value-pluralism.">Growth might let
us promote value pluralism.</h4>
<p>Value pluralism is the notion that multiple important values often
conflict and that there’s no easy way to rank them in order of
importance. For instance, a community might debate whether to spend its
limited resources on building a new hospital or a cultural center. Some
community members might argue that healthcare is the most urgent need,
while others might say that arts and culture are equally important for
the community’s wellbeing. With sustained economic growth—and therefore
increased wealth over time–—the community might not need to make such
tough choices. Instead of selecting a hospital or a cultural center, the
community could build both. Growth can enable <em>Pareto
improvements</em>: changes that improve people’s lives without leaving
anyone worse off; it is like growing a pie to give everyone bigger
slices. The increased wealth effectively allows for the accommodation of
multiple values without prioritizing one over the other.<p>
Economic growth, while advantageous, doesn’t resolve all issues stemming
from value pluralism. It often prioritizes efficiency over equity, and
wealth over values such as environmental sustainability. People’s unique
experiences, cultures, and beliefs shape their values, so debates about
fair resource distribution or balancing freedoms with obligations could
still arise in a resource-abundant society. Despite not being a
comprehensive solution for value pluralism, economic growth provides a
helpful approach to achieving broader societal goals.</p>
<h4 id="we-have-strong-reasons-for-encouraging-economic-growth.">We have
strong reasons for encouraging economic growth.</h4>
<p>Looking at the world over the last 200 years provides strong evidence
that economic growth can lead to vast improvements in human life through
health, freedom, education, and more.<p>
</p>
<figure id="fig:preston">

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 6.2: Increases in GDP per capita strongly correlate with increases in life expectancy.</p>
<!--<figcaption>Increases in GDP per capita strongly correlate with-->

</figure>
<p>The Preston curve is compelling evidence of a positive correlation
between a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—a measure of
the total production of goods and services–—and health outcomes. This
relationship illustrates that countries with higher GDP per capita have
better health outcomes, and particularly that poorer countries stand to
benefit immensely from improvements in GDP. This also holds across time:
average global life expectancy was just below 40 years at the start of
the 20th century, whereas today, with a much higher global GDP per
capita, the average person expects to live for 70 years. Nobel laureate
Amartya Sen suggests that one pathway through which growth improves
health is by reducing poverty and increasing investments in healthcare
<span class="citation" data-cites="sen1999economics">[4]</span>.<p>
The benefits of economic growth extend beyond physical health. There is
a strong association between economic prosperity and enhancements in
freedom and education <span class="citation"
data-cites="heckelman2000economic">[5]</span>. Economic growth can
facilitate better educational opportunities by enabling more funding for
schools, teacher salaries, and educational resources. This, in turn, can
boost literacy rates, educational attainment, and, ultimately, the
knowledge capital of a society. With more resources at their disposal,
people have more options and opportunities. They can pursue varied
careers, invest in personal development, and engage more actively in
civil society. Moreover, prosperous societies can afford stronger
institutions to safeguard democratic freedoms and human rights.
Additionally, economic growth can nurture the arts. As societies become
wealthier, more resources can be allocated to support cultural
institutions, artists, and creative endeavors. This can lead to a
flourishing of the arts, enriching societal culture and enhancing
individual life experiences.</p>
<h4 id="compound-growth-is-powerful.">Compound growth is powerful.</h4>
<p>The effect of small increases in economic growth becomes apparent
when we consider the effects of compound growth over time. Even small
differences in annual growth rates can profoundly impact future
generations. For instance, if an economy grows at 1% per year, our
grandchildren would have twice our current income in 70 years. However,
if the economy grows at 2% per year, our children’s income in 35 years
would be double ours and our grandchildren’s income would quadruple.
Economic growth has the potential to create a significantly more
prosperous future. Prioritizing growth, therefore, can be a powerful
strategy for enhancing societal wellbeing now and in the future.</p>
<h4 id="increasing-growth-through-ai-seems-promising.">Increasing growth
through AI seems promising.</h4>
<p>AI might be a significant driver of economic growth in the coming
decades. From automating tasks such as grading tests in the education
sector to creating new sophisticated possibilities such as advanced
radiology diagnostics in healthcare, AI has the potential to boost
economic performance considerably. In the automobile industry, for
instance, the application of AI to autonomous vehicles could be
revolutionary, reducing human error and increasing efficiency in
transport and logistics. The potential for vast economic growth from AI
gives us reason to be optimistic about the future. If economic growth
improves health, education, and overall quality of life–—as we have
considered is possible—the AI-driven economy could significantly enhance
societal wellbeing.</p>
<h4
id="however-while-growth-is-correlated-with-welfare-its-benefits-are-neither-predictable-nor-uniform.">However,
while growth is correlated with welfare, its benefits are neither
predictable nor uniform.</h4>
<p>Growth might be unsustainable, trading off long-term wellbeing for
gains today. Even if we have sustainable growth, we need to consider the
distribution of that growth. Will economic growth from AI benefit
everyone or only a select few? AI might create jobs in some sectors and
eliminate them in others due to automation. Therefore, while AI has the
potential to boost economic growth, we need to address risks like the
unequal distribution of benefits.</p>
<h4 id="similarly-efficiency-is-desirable-but-insufficient.">Similarly,
efficiency is desirable but insufficient.</h4>
<p>While the concept of the “Invisible Hand” suggests that self-interest
and free markets lead to competition and efficiency, these just as often
lead to markets in which competition is eliminated. MBA programs teach
business executives how to avoid Porter’s Five Forces, ensuring that
their businesses are in an industry with low competition, high barriers
to entry, customers and suppliers that have weak price-setting power,
and low threat of substitute products. These are contrary to the
conditions of the First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics and
therefore undermine efficiency. In <em>The Theory of Moral
Sentiments</em>, Adam Smith himself recognized that self-interest and
free markets are sufficient only on paper: he thought that our concern
for others is essential and celebrated our sense of justice, generosity,
and public spirit.<p>
Similarly, metrics of efficiency don’t always tell us whether the
economy is contributing to social welfare; for instance, Pareto
efficient distributions can be extremely unequal. As an extreme example,
if one person has all the resources in the economy, no one else can be
made better off without taking away something from that person.
Analogously, AIs may worsen income inequality by benefiting mainly
business owners and shareholders at the expense of workers who may be
cheaply replaced. Additionally, AIs may be used to promote monopolistic
practices or violate our preferences for personal privacy in ways that
are nonetheless efficient.<p>
In essence, we must recognize that markets are not perfect: they can
cause problems such as inequality and market failures. These and other
related issues will be discussed in further detail in the next
section.<p>
</p>
<h2 id="inequality-market-failures">6.4.2 Inequality &amp; Market
Failures</h2>
<p>The previous section on markets and efficiency painted a rosy picture
of real-world markets. In reality, we rarely see markets perform at this
ideal standard. Economic growth is often talked about as an intrinsic
good, but is only ever an instrumental one: it is not valuable for
itself, but for the positive effects it has on society. However, even
when markets are productively and allocatively efficient, creating
wealth for everyone, they might impose harmful side effects. Two reasons
for this are that markets generate <em>inequality</em> and are often
subject to <em>market failures</em>.<p>
First, we will explore the relevance of inequality in understanding
societal wellbeing, what tools can be used to measure its effects, and
why concerns about inequality are not just limited to those at the
bottom. Then, we will consider the potential implications of AI on
employment and income inequality, and how societies across the globe may
be impacted by an economy restructured by AI. We will also examine
various types of market failures: instances where markets fail to
allocate goods and services optimally. We will discuss information
asymmetries, the monopolistic power of large firms, and negative
externalities—consequences that extend beyond the direct participants of
a trade. All of these undermine the argument that an unregulated market
is sufficient for AIs to create widespread benefits for all.</p>
<h3 id="inequality">Inequality</h3>
<p><em>Inequality is on the rise and harms many people, including many
of those getting richer. The widespread use of AIs might sharpen
inequality, decreasing social wellbeing.</em></p>
<h4 id="most-of-the-world-exhibits-high-levels-of-inequality.">Most of
the world exhibits high levels of inequality.</h4>
<p>In economics, inequality refers to the uneven distribution of
economic resources, including income and living conditions. The <em>Gini
coefficient</em> is a commonly used statistical measure of income or
wealth distribution within a country. It is a number between 0 and 1,
where 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income or
wealth), and 1 signifies maximum inequality (one person has all the
income or wealth, and everyone else has none). Looking at Gini
coefficients, 71% of the world’s population lives in countries with
increasing inequality over the last thirty years <span class="citation"

in the United States is particularly striking.</h4>
<p>Figure 6.3 shows that the Gini coefficient in the
US has trended significantly upwards from 1969 to 2019. Over 50 years,
the pre-tax Gini coefficient has increased by 30%, while the post-tax
Gini coefficient has risen by 25%, suggesting that despite
redistributive taxation policies, the US income gap has widened
substantially. (For reference, this change in Gini coefficient is the
same size as moving from Canada to Saudi Arabia today. <span
class="citation" data-cites="UN2020inequality">[6]</span>) This increase
in the Gini coefficient is evidence of a growing inequality crisis. An
associated fall in social mobility—the ability of an individual to move
from the bottom income bracket to the top—cements inequalities over
generations.<p>

<h4 id="inequality-carries-serious-implications.">Inequality carries
serious implications.</h4>
<p>For those worst off in an unequal society, the implications are
severe. Beyond obvious problems like an inability to access essentials
and maintain a basic standard of living, there are additional concerns
in domains like health. A widening wealth gap often corresponds with a
health gap, where those with fewer resources have poorer health outcomes
due to less access to quality healthcare, lower quality nutrition, and
higher stress levels. For instance, life expectancy often varies
dramatically based on income in unequal societies: the average life
expectancy of the lowest-income classes in America now matches the
averages in Sudan or Pakistan <span class="citation"
data-cites="wilkinson2009spirit">[9]</span>.</p>
<h4
id="everyone-not-just-the-poorest-suffers-in-an-unequal-society.">Everyone,
not just the poorest, suffers in an unequal society.</h4>
<p>One of the most robust findings is that unequal societies have higher
levels of crime <span class="citation"
data-cites="kelly2000inequality">[10]</span>. When inequality is high,
so too are levels of social tension, dissatisfaction, and shame, which
can contribute to higher crime rates. This can lead to a cycle where the
fear of crime drives further inequality, as wealthier individuals and
neighborhoods invest in measures that segregate them further from the
rest of society, further increasing inequality and crime rates. A more
detailed discussion of this relative deprivation can be found in the
section on Cooperation and Conflict. Inequality is also related to other
signs of societal sickness: worse physical and mental health, increased
drug use, and higher rates of incarceration. Strikingly, inequality is a
strong predictor of political instability and violence as well. While it
may seem like those with more wealth are insulated from the negative
effects of inequality, in reality they suffer indirect consequences as
well.<p>

<h4 id="the-causes-of-inequality-are-disputed.">The causes of inequality
are disputed.</h4>
<p>Renowned economist Thomas Piketty, in his book “Capital in the 21st
Century,” posits that inequality results from the difference between the
interest rate investments in capital receive (r) and the rate of
economic growth (g) <span class="citation"
data-cites="piketty2014capital">[11]</span>. Essentially, when the
returns from investing wealth (r) surpass the overall growth rate (g),
society tends to become more unequal. This happens because the rich can
profit significantly from investing their existing wealth, while average
individuals cannot realize the same benefits from overall economic
growth. However, Piketty’s theory has met criticisms, especially when
considering its application to the future; for instance, he assumes that
the technological frontier can only grow at 1.5% per year, a limitation
that could potentially be overturned by advancements in AI.<p>
Countless other theories seek to explain the rise in inequality. One
possibility is that an increased reward for technical skills has led to
a widening gap between those with high-skill jobs and those without.
Other theories point to the decline of labor unions, which traditionally
advocated for worker rights and better wages, as a contributing factor.
The driving forces behind rising inequality are undoubtedly
multifaceted, warranting a careful and nuanced examination.</p>
<h4
id="ai-might-prompt-higher-returns-on-investments-for-the-wealthy.">AI
might prompt higher returns on investments for the wealthy.</h4>
<p>AI could significantly impact income inequality, intensifying
existing disparities. Investments in AI may yield higher productivity
compared to past opportunities, leading to a higher rate of return on
capital. Following Piketty’s theory of inequality, AI might exacerbate
inequality if it increases the capital return rate more than it
increases total growth if the wealthy can invest in AIs more than
everyone else. This seems likely: those with existing capital (such as
GPUs) are likely to be able to deploy and benefit from AIs far more than
the average person. Additionally, the benefits from AIs might be
concentrated among the owners of AI companies, giving them astronomical
amounts of wealth rather than distributing these benefits widely.</p>
<h4 id="automation-using-ai-might-increase-inequality.">Automation using
AI might increase inequality.</h4>
<p>If AIs are more productive than humans, as is likely to become the
case in many industries, automating human labor will increase profits
and returns on investment. Investors would likely opt for AI over human
labor since AI presents a more cost-effective and productive
alternative. A broad shift towards AI as a form of capital might prompt
the wealthy to invest more heavily in AI technologies than businesses
that rely on human labor. As businesses transition towards AI, the
demand for human labor may decrease, resulting in job losses. As a
result, workers’ bargaining power could be significantly reduced: a
surplus of labor could force wages down and weaken workers’ conditions,
benefits, and protections. If a job is automated, then conventional
bargaining tactics like striking are no longer an option. Such a
scenario would contribute to growing inequality and negatively impact
the livelihoods of workers.<p>
Although new technologies may create novel job opportunities, the
large-scale integration of AI could render many existing roles
redundant. Numerous job sectors are susceptible to replacement by AI.
Unlike in the past, even knowledge-based jobs such as writing and
programming are at risk due to advancements in AI such as large language
models, robotics, and computer vision. The advent of self-driving cars
could potentially displace the vast portion of the 5 million Americans
driving for a living. Similarly, advancements in robotics might threaten
the employment of the 12 million Americans working in manufacturing
<span class="citation" data-cites="yang2018war">[12]</span>. Since
software is cheap to duplicate, AI presents firms around the globe with
a low-cost and scalable alternative to using human labor. Mass
unemployment could result in severe inequality—establishing a divide
between the minority who own these transformative technologies and the
majority unable to find work.</p>
<h4
id="past-revolutions-have-relocated-employment-not-destroyed-it.">Past
revolutions have relocated employment, not destroyed it.</h4>
<p>A common counterargument brought up in discussions about the
potential impact of AI on employment draws on historical evidence of
technological revolutions. Advocates of this view argue that while past
technological advancements–—like the industrial revolution or the
computer age–—did indeed displace certain jobs, they simultaneously
created entirely new types of work. Instead of an overall reduction in
employment, the nature of employment was transformed. This phenomenon,
called creative destruction, describes how outdated industries and jobs
are replaced by new, often more efficient ones.</p>
<h4 id="however-human-level-ai-might-destroy-employment.">However,
human-level AI might destroy employment.</h4>
<p>It is important to remember that past transformative technologies,
such as mechanized looms or computers, automated <em>specific</em> tasks
or functions, leaving plenty of room for the workforce to adapt and
evolve. For example, the advent of computers rendered certain roles
obsolete, like typists using typewriters. But it also opened up an array
of new job categories—software developers, IT specialists, and data
analysts, to name a few. Therefore, while these changes were disruptive
for certain professions, they ultimately led to a shift in employment
rather than mass unemployment. This is likely to continue in the face of
AI development in the short run.<p>
By contrast, human-level AI has the potential to automate tasks across
most sectors in the long run. This could be through individual AIs
excelling in specific tasks or an artificial general intelligence
capable of doing it all. This situation creates a fundamental difference
from past technological advancements that both helped and displaced
human workers. If we can automate any job inexpensively, it’s unclear
where humans would fit into the economy.</p>
<h3 id="market-failure">Market Failure</h3>
<p><em>AI development is aligned with the economic engine. We thought
that this was good because the economy creates efficiency. However, in
many cases, markets fail to deliver efficient outcomes. AIs may amplify
or create these failures.</em></p>
<h4
id="there-are-a-few-common-types-of-market-failure-that-might-concern-us.">There
are a few common types of market failure that might concern us.</h4>
<p>While markets are often efficient and usually yield better outcomes
than alternative methods like the allocation of resources by the
government, they are not perfectly suited to all types of trade.
Sometimes, when left to their own devices, markets often fail to
allocate resources in the most efficient way, leading to outcomes that
may be unfavorable from a societal standpoint, even if they appear to be
operating smoothly. These issues can be especially amplified in the
context of powerful AI systems. The chapter analyzes market failures
involving the overuse of common access resources like fish in the sea.
In this section, we consider three more common types of market failures
that are pertinent to our discussion about AI: <em>information
asymmetries</em>, <em>monopoly power</em>, and
<em>externalities</em>.</p>
<h4
id="information-known-to-only-some-can-create-market-failures.">Information
known to only some can create market failures.</h4>
<p>Information asymmetry captures the idea that buyers and sellers have
different information regarding the product they are trading. For
instance, buyers are keenly aware of the product’s quality and
specifications, and sellers know their true willingness to pay for the
product. Information asymmetry isn’t inherently problematic and is, in
fact, often a positive aspect of market dynamics. We trust specialists
to provide valuable services in their respective fields; for instance,
we rely on our mechanics to know more about our car’s inner workings
than we do.<p>
However, issues arise when an imbalance of information is exploited
disingenuously. A classic example of this can be found in the used car
market. A dealer may be aware that a car’s axle is rapidly wearing out,
a defect that isn’t immediately noticeable to a potential buyer. By
withholding this information, the dealer could sell the car at a price
higher than its true value. The buyer, left in the dark, may end up
facing unexpected repair costs soon after purchase. This is also
referred to as <em>adverse selection</em>: when one party in a
transaction uses their access to private information to their advantage.
Here, the car dealer is using their private knowledge of the car’s
condition to make a sale at an unfair profit.</p>
<h4 id="ais-can-cause-strong-informational-asymmetries.">AIs can cause
strong informational asymmetries.</h4>
<p>AI holds the power to both create and exploit information asymmetries
in unprecedented ways. This capacity can be employed in beneficial ways,
like providing highly personalized services or excellent
recommendations. However, it can also be misused, leading to situations
in which those using AIs can manipulate consumers. AI-powered analytics
allows companies to create sophisticated profiles of consumers that can
uncover deep insights into individual personalities and behaviors. <span
class="citation" data-cites="rust2005psychometrics">[13]</span> Big tech
companies already use social media and device activity to understand an
individual’s preferences and vulnerabilities better than ever before.
This knowledge can be cunningly used to shape targeted advertisements or
manipulations that are hard for people to resist.</p>
<p>While AI magnifies the potential for information asymmetries, such
strategies have long standing precedents in non-AI contexts. Predatory
lending is a common practice where lenders, often equipped with more
information than borrowers, use deceptive practices to encourage
individuals into accepting unfair loan terms. These tactics tend to
target lower-income and less-educated individuals who might not have the
time or background to understand the fine-print of what they’re signing,
or the resources to find legal counsel. AI can further increase the
power imbalance; for instance, AI can be used to predict who is most
likely to accept these unfair loan terms based on their digital
behavior, leading to even more targeted predatory lending. AI can both
amplify existing issues and present new challenges.</p>
<h4
id="markets-can-be-monopolistic-instead-of-perfectly-competitive.">Markets
can be monopolistic instead of perfectly competitive.</h4>
<p>We earlier discussed how competition can create productive efficiency
and how a failure of competition might corrupt this equilibrium. A
market is said to be perfectly competitive when it contains a large
number of firms that sell effectively identical products, with no
barriers to new firms joining the market, such that no single firm has
the power to influence the market price on its own. A good example is
the market for many food items, such as milk. No one dairy firm can
single-handedly raise the price of milk, and both grocery stores and
consumers have a variety of brand options. Perfectly competitive markets
are generally favorable for consumers, offering a wide array of quality
options and keeping prices down due to competition among firms.<p>
In contrast, an imperfectly competitive market is one where one or more
firms gain enough influence to impact the market price. Such firms are
able to avoid some competitive pressures; for instance, they can raise
their own prices without losing many consumers to competitors. This
ability is referred to as market control or monopoly power. In the case
of the technology industry, big tech companies such as Apple have
considerable influence over the price of their products due to their
market dominance and unique offerings. When a single company or a small
group of companies has this level of control, consumers are left with
limited product options and higher prices.</p>
<h4 id="monopolies-can-harm-consumers.">Monopolies can harm
consumers.</h4>
<p>Consider De Beers, a company historically dominant in the diamond
industry. For much of the 20th century, De Beers controlled a vast
majority of the global diamond market. By monopolizing the supply chain,
they were able to artificially inflate diamond prices and manipulate
consumer demand through aggressive marketing strategies. This control
meant limited choices and inflated prices for consumers, as there were
few alternative sources for diamonds. The situation has gradually
changed with the emergence of new players and diamond sources in the
market, but De Beers’ long-standing monopoly serves as a classic example
of how concentrated market power can distort the pricing and
availability of common goods. To prevent market control and preserve the
benefits of competition, governments implement antitrust laws. These
laws give governments the power to break up companies with too much
control or prevent mergers between large competitors.</p>
<h4
id="high-initial-investment-requirements-can-impede-newcomers-from-entering-the-market.">High
initial investment requirements can impede newcomers from entering the
market.</h4>
<p>Historically, first-movers in capital-intensive industries have a
competitive advantage, such as rail companies that own large quantities
of railway networks. In such industries, it is difficult for other firms
to enter the market due to high up-front costs; in many cases, an
existing firm can block other firms from entering, such as by keeping
prices below a sustainable level. AI development might be similar—at the
very least, firms within it might have some monopoly power that allows
them to avoid many competitive pressures.</p>
<p>Developing a large model requires paying substantial fixed costs
up-front, including expenses for computing power and datasets essential
for training. However, once these initial investments are made, the
subsequent cost per user for deploying and maintaining these models are
considerably lower. Since the average cost per unit decreases as the
number of customers increases, it becomes substantially more
cost-effective for a single AI company to provide access to many people
than for multiple companies to independently develop and maintain
similar models.<p>
Additionally, only a few companies might have access to enough resources
and data to create the best AI models. In the chapter), we discussed how
scaling laws demonstrate that improving AI performance has required
access to costly resources like high-performance processors and vast,
high-quality datasets. High resource requirements for developing
advanced AI can limit market entry, stifling competition. Additionally,
early capability advantages for a leading firm can have positive
feedback loops and Matthew effect dynamics, which could enable them to
raise more capital and pull ahead from many competitors. The possibility
of monopoly power raises concerns that only a few powerful entities will
have access to and benefit from AI technologies.</p>
<h4 id="the-use-of-ai-might-create-monopolies.">The use of AI might
create monopolies.</h4>
<p>AI developers are striving to have their models achieve
superintelligence: models that are able to carry out a wide range of
tasks across various domains better than humans. If someone did manage
to create such an AI, they might have a decisive advantage across large
swathes of industry, being sufficiently versatile to become an expert in
many or every market. It may become difficult or impossible for smaller
firms to carve out niche market spaces. The advanced capabilities of
general AI may outpace specialized models in diverse domains, making it
more difficult for new entrants to gain market share. Large firms
equipped with powerful AI systems could wield an enormous amount of
power, potentially leading to less competition, higher prices, and
slower innovation, hurting both labor and product markets.</p>
<h4
id="externalities-are-consequences-of-economic-activity-that-impact-unrelated-third-parties.">Externalities
are consequences of economic activity that impact unrelated third
parties.</h4>
<p>An externality is a side effect that stems from an economic activity,
impacting individuals or groups who are not directly involved in that
activity. Because of externalities, market prices for goods or services
may not fully reflect the costs that third parties, who are neither the
consumers or the producers of that market, bear as a result of the
economic activity.<p>
A classic example of a negative externality–—a harm to a third party—is
the case of pollution. Consider the Sriracha factory in Irwindale,
California, where jalapeño peppers are ground and roasted. Residents of
Irwingdale claimed that odors from the factory caused lung and eye
irritation and created an overall unpleasant smell in the town. The
factory, by producing these odors, was imposing a negative externality
upon the town’s residents, but since the townspeople received no
automatic compensation for this inconvenience, this was not reflected in
the price of Sriracha.</p>
<h4
id="we-can-resolve-externalities-with-litigation-property-rights-and-taxation.">We
can resolve externalities with litigation, property rights, and
taxation.</h4>
<p>In 2013, locals sued the Sriracha factory: this legal action led the
factory to install new filters to reduce pollution. Litigation can be an
effective tool to resolve externalities by forcing compensation.
Economic theory suggests that bargaining over the externality can also
create efficient outcomes; for instance, if the property right to the
air was understood to belong to the townspeople, and that the factory
would have to stop polluting or compensate the townspeople at an
acceptable rate for their inconvenience <span class="citation"
data-cites="lafleur2013coase">[14]</span>.<p>
A third commonly used resolution to externalities is taxation. Smoking
cigarettes imposes negative externalities on those near the smoker;
governments will thus impose taxes on the sale of tobacco, which both
raise revenues for the state to run social programs and discourage
smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes to better reflect its true
total cost. Determining the most effective method for resolving each
externality is a topic of ongoing debate among economists. Externalities
and their potential solutions provide crucial context when considering
the broader impacts of AI on society.</p>
<h4
id="the-development-and-deployment-of-ai-systems-can-lead-to-negative-externalities.">The
development and deployment of AI systems can lead to negative
externalities.</h4>
<p>The high energy consumption of advanced AI is a significant negative
externality on the environment. Training advanced AI models requires
vast computational resources, consuming a significant amount of energy
and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions can lead to
climate change, a cost borne by society at large, rather than only by
those who pollute. Another externality is related to data privacy. AI
systems require large volumes of data to learn and improve. People’s
privacy can be compromised if data is obtained without consent,
mishandled, misused, or leaked. Privacy breaches are costly to
individuals whose data is exposed, but this cost isn’t borne by
companies, who are rarely forced to compensate for damages.</p>
<h4 id="summary.">Summary.</h4>
<p>We examined why inequality and market failures are primary concerns
in market systems and understood a few concrete pathways that these take
root. Unfortunately, AIs might exacerbate inequality, creating
disproportionate gains for the wealthy individuals and firms that create
it. AIs may also cause market failures by intensifying informational
asymmetries, enabling monopolies, and generating negative externalities
such as greenhouse gas emissions and violations of privacy. In the next
section, we will expand upon the idea that economic models fail to
capture many of the things we care about.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-economic-models">6.4.3 Beyond Economic Models</h2>
<p>In measuring societal wellbeing, we must recognize the shortcomings
of traditional economic metrics. Here, we will discuss the disconnect
between economic output and social value, why relying on economic models
of welfare economics can be inadequate in describing human goals, and
how more holistic measures of happiness and economic prosperity may give
us a clearer sense of true societal wellbeing.</p>
<h3 id="economic-output-and-gross-domestic-product">Economic Output and
Gross Domestic Product</h3>
<p><em>Economic output is only a proxy for what we care about;
maximizing it will often fail to maximize social wellbeing. Therefore,
AIs should not be given the objective of maximizing economic
output.</em></p>
<h4
id="economic-indicators-measure-what-we-can-quantify-not-necessarily-what-we-care-about.">Economic
indicators measure what we can quantify, not necessarily what we care
about.</h4>
<p>Indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measure the monetary
value of final goods and services–—that is, those that are bought by the
final user–—produced in a country in a given period of time. When
economists discuss growth, they are typically referring to increases in
GDP. Measures of productive output like GDP are useful in gauging a
country’s economic health, but they fail to capture the value of
socially significant activities that aren’t priced in the market.</p>
<h4 id="socially-important-tasks-are-not-captured-by-gdp.">Socially
important tasks are not captured by GDP.</h4>
<p>Many essential roles in society, such as parenthood, community
service, and early education, are crucial to the wellbeing of
individuals and communities but are often undervalued or entirely
overlooked in GDP calculations <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2016gdp">[15]</span>. While their effects might be
captured–—education, for instance, will increase productivity, which
increases GDP–—the initial activity does not count. The reason is
simple: GDP only accounts for activities that have a market price.
Consequently, efforts expended in these socially important tasks,
despite their high intrinsic value, are not reflected in the GDP
figures.</p>
<h4
id="technologies-that-make-our-lives-better-may-not-be-measured-either.">Technologies
that make our lives better may not be measured either.</h4>
<p>Technological advancements and their resultant value often fail to be
reflected adequately in GDP figures. For instance, numerous open-source
projects like Wikipedia provide knowledge to internet users worldwide at
no cost. However, because there’s no direct monetary transaction
involved, the immense value they offer isn’t represented in GDP. The
same applies to user-generated content on platforms like YouTube, where
the main contribution to GDP is through advertisement revenue and most
creators aren’t compensated for the value they create. The value viewers
derive from such platforms vastly outstrips the revenue generated from
ads or sales on these platforms, but this is not reflected in GDP.</p>
<h4
id="there-might-be-a-similar-disconnect-between-gdp-and-the-social-value-of-ai.">There
might be a similar disconnect between GDP and the social value of
AI.</h4>
<p>As artificial intelligence systems become more integrated into our
daily lives, the disconnect between GDP and social value might become
more pronounced. For example, an AI system that provides free education
resources may significantly improve learning outcomes for millions, but
its contribution would be largely invisible in GDP terms. Similarly, an
AI may substantially increase GDP by facilitating high-frequency trading
without doing much to increase social wellbeing. This growing chasm
between economic metrics and real value could lead to policy decisions
that fail to harness the full potential of AI or inadvertently hamper
its beneficial applications. Recognizing this gap is a vital step
towards devising better ways of measuring and encouraging the socially
beneficial use of AI.</p>
<h4
id="increasing-output-does-not-imply-increasing-social-value.">Increasing
output does not imply increasing social value.</h4>
<p>The true costs of economic output can often be hidden or overlooked
in pursuit of growth. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
UNICEF estimates that 40,000 children work in cobalt mines, often in
hazardous conditions. While this labor may contribute to the country’s
economic output, the adverse effects on these children’s health and
education plausibly outweigh the short-term economic gains, and these
practices conflict with commonly held principles around the exploitation
of children. Much like in the high-frequency trading example above, more
output doesn’t necessarily correspond to increased social value. AIs
that maximize GDP as a proxy for social value may attempt high-frequency
trading or the use of exploitative labor practices, proxy gaming to
maximize its reward.<p>
Similarly, an increase in work hours could lead to heightened
productivity and output, but not necessarily enhanced societal
wellbeing. In the US, for example, workers highly value their leisure
time and often prioritize it over potential economic benefits of working
longer hours. In contrast, cultures with longer average work hours, such
as China, might have a different perspective on the balance between work
and leisure. Despite the country’s impressive economic growth in recent
decades, levels of self-reported happiness haven’t increased
proportionally, potentially due to growing income inequality <span
class="citation" data-cites="earterlin2012china">[16]</span>. Such
evidence suggests that an increase in output does not always translate
to an improvement in quality of life. We must consider factors beyond
economic metrics when assessing the societal impact of policies and
practices, particularly those involving AI systems. This perspective is
especially important when deploying AI systems that could significantly
influence the future of work.</p>
<h4 id="the-financialization-of-everything.">The financialization of
everything.</h4>
<p>Another way in which economic output can be at odds with our values
is through the growing trend of financialization—monetizing various
aspects of private or public life <span class="citation"
data-cites="sandel2012money">[17]</span>. Increasingly, potent
algorithms are deployed to "optimize" life in various ways, with a
primary focus on profitability, sometimes at the expense of intrinsic
human values. These algorithms can distort the alignment between
technology and societal values. Consider aspects like love, friendship,
human rights, freedom, and environmental preservation. These are areas
we instinctively try to protect from the realm of commerce; for example,
people who sell friendship are often seen as degrading the value of
friendship. Unlike commodities that get depleted with use, altruism,
solidarity, and civic spirit can actually increase with use, much like
muscles that develop and become stronger when regularly used. These are
reasons we do not want to financialize virtues or many aspects of
life.<p>
However, economic incentives within markets often compel innovators to
monetize these aspects. Consider an experiment where a daycare center
imposed fines on parents who were late in picking up their children.
Instead of serving as a deterrent, the fine doubled the number of late
arrivals. Parents saw the fine not as a penalty, but as a service charge
for extended care, effectively absolving them of any guilt related to
tardiness. When the fine was eventually eliminated, the late pickups
didn’t decrease but rather increased. The financial penalty had
disappeared, but the original sense of guilt associated with late
pickups did not return <span class="citation"
data-cites="raworth2017doughnut">[18]</span>. This case demonstrates the
risk of allowing financialization into areas of life traditionally
governed by non-market norms; we might inadvertently erode the very
values we hold dear, like parental responsibility and respect for
others’ time.</p>
<h4
id="the-proxy-purpose-distinction-is-especially-important-for-ai.">The
proxy-purpose distinction is especially important for AI.</h4>
<p>Imagine a future where an AI system is tasked with maximizing GDP,
often seen as a proxy for wellbeing. The system could potentially
achieve this goal by promoting resource-intensive industries or
fostering a work culture that prioritizes productivity over wellbeing.
In such a scenario, the GDP might increase, but at the cost of essential
considerations like environmental sustainability and human happiness.
Therefore, relying solely on economic indicators could lead to decisions
that, while effective in the short term, might harm society in the long
run.<p>
Understanding the limitations of economic measurements is an important
step towards a safer use of AI. It helps us question what we should
optimize. The aim of economic policy should not just be to maximize
economic output but also to promote overall societal wellbeing. AI
systems may thus need to take into account multiple factors, like
equality, sustainability, and personal fulfillment, rather than only
economic indicators. Such an approach could pave the way for a future
where AI contributes positively to steering society without compromising
the values we hold dear.</p>
<h3 id="models-of-welfare-economics">Models of Welfare Economics</h3>
<p><em>Models of welfare economics try to maximize a quantity called
“social surplus.” While this sounds good, social surplus differs from
social wellbeing.</em></p>
<h4
id="the-most-basic-form-of-welfare-economics-maximizes-social-surplus.">The
most basic form of welfare economics maximizes social surplus.</h4>
<p>Social surplus is a measure of the total value created by a market:
it is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus. The
consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer
is willing to pay and the actual market price. Conversely, the producer
surplus is the difference between the actual market price and the
minimum price a producer is willing to accept for a product or service.
By maximizing the total surplus, welfare economics seeks to maximize the
social value created by a market.<p>
For instance, imagine a scenario where consumers are willing to pay up
to $20 for a book, but the market price is only $15. Here, the consumer
surplus is $5. Similarly, if a producer is willing to sell the book for
a minimum of $10, the producer surplus is $5. The social surplus, and
hence the social value in this market, is $10: $5 consumer surplus plus
$5 producer surplus.</p>
<h4 id="we-should-be-wary-of-generalizing-from-simple-models.">We should
be wary of generalizing from simple models.</h4>
<p>The core model of welfare economics has its limitations. Notably,
welfare economics is concerned with the maximization of surplus, but is
indifferent to its distribution. This might not align with societal
notions of fairness and equality. For example, an AI optimized to
maximize profits might model consumers well enough to enable perfect
price discrimination: allowing firms to sell each good at exactly a
consumer’s maximum willingness to pay, converting all the consumer
surplus into producer surplus, but leaving the sum total of “social
surplus” unchanged.<p>
However, social surplus is not the only thing we care about. Since
utility functions with respect to money are concave, we care about how
rich consumers and producers are to begin with. If, as is usually the
case, consumers are poorer than the owners of a company, then
transferring $5 (of surplus) from consumers to producers decreases total
utility. The real gains for the firm may be small compared to the losses
for the consumers.<p>
As AI systems become more integral to our economies, we must be mindful
of these complexities. A narrow focus on maximizing economic surplus
could lead us to promote AIs which, while efficient in a purely economic
sense, might have alarming consequences for society.</p>
<h4
id="basic-economic-theory-confuses-ability-with-willingness-to-pay.">Basic
economic theory confuses ability with willingness to pay.</h4>
<p>When determining social value, economic theory implicitly equates
ability to pay with willingness to pay. This assumption can lead to
distorted conclusions about what generates social value because these
two concepts should be distinct: ability to pay reflects an individual’s
financial capacity, while willingness to pay expresses their desire or
need for a good or service. The person who pays the most for a good is
not the person who values it the most.<p>
Consider a situation where both a billionaire and an average-income
individual require a life-saving drug. Both parties are willing to pay
whatever they can to obtain it. The billionaire is able to pay
astronomically more due to their wealth, despite the fact that the drug
provides the same life-saving value to both the billionaire and the
average-income person. The welfare economics model, in maximizing total
surplus, would interpret the billionaire’s purchase as creating a vastly
greater social value because the difference between the billionaire’s
purchase price and their willingness to pay is so great—an unsettling
conclusion that contradicts most moral perspectives.<p>
This disconnect is highlighted by differences between the developed and
developing world; those in the former have a relatively tiny ability to
pay. It seems unlikely that the preferences of someone in a wealthy
country are 100 times more intense than someone from the third world,
and yet their ability to pay is. It is similarly unlikely that Jeff
Bezos’s preferences are a million times more intense than the average US
citizen’s; yet, his ability to pay is. The economic engine is only
sensitive to ability to pay, not utility derived. As a result, the
market is distorted: individuals with astronomically high wealth are
prioritized astronomically, while those with nothing have no part to
play in the free markets’ allocation of value.</p>
<h4 id="economics-is-not-fundamentally-utilitarian.">Economics is not
fundamentally utilitarian.</h4>
<p>The economic engine violates Bentham’s basic principle of
utilitarianism: “Everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one.”
Instead, people count for how much they can pay. In general, economics
is chiefly concerned with the efficient allocation of resources to help
satisfy people’s revealed economic preferences: what consumers and
producers are shown as willing to demand and supply at various prices.
However, revealed preferences about products are a narrow subset of
revealed preferences in general, and revealed economic preferences are
distinct from other sorts of preferences, such as idealized preferences.
Consequently, economics has differing objectives from theories like
preference utilitarianism that aim to maximize the satisfaction of
preferences in general. The economic engine is not a preference
maximization engine; instead, it is better thought of as a wealth
maximization engine. For example, although many people would welcome AIs
that aid education or assist medical research to benefit many, we may
just as soon see AIs that conduct highly effective subliminal marketing,
which may only benefit a few.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-in-economics">Happiness in Economics</h3>
<p><em>Economists are unsure what exactly creates happiness, but
material wealth is probably only one part of the picture.</em></p>
<h4
id="there-is-a-gap-between-human-happiness-and-material-prosperity.">There
is a gap between human happiness and material prosperity.</h4>
<p>Most people would agree that the goal of social sciences should not
be to just increase material wealth. A more meaningful aim would be to
enhance overall wellbeing or happiness. However, defining and measuring
happiness can be challenging. Whether happiness is correlated with
material wealth remains an ongoing research question; other aspects of
life like physical and mental health, job satisfaction, social
connections, and a sense of purpose seem important as well.</p>
<h4
id="debates-about-the-easterlin-paradox-highlight-the-complexity-of-understanding-happiness.">Debates
about the Easterlin paradox highlight the complexity of understanding
happiness.</h4>
<p>While wealthier people and countries are generally happier than their
less affluent counterparts, long-term economic growth does not always
correlate with long-term increases in happiness: this is the Easterlin
paradox. Several studies have tried to explore the relationship between
happiness and economic growth <span class="citation"
data-cites="earterlin2012china">[16]</span>. While some findings suggest
a correlation, others don’t, highlighting that our understanding of the
happiness-growth relationship is still evolving.<p>
We do, however, have strong evidence that inequality is unhelpful.
People often evaluate their wellbeing in relation to others; so, when
wealth distribution is unequal, people are dissatisfied and unhappy. For
instance, the recent rise in inequality may explain why there has been
no significant increase in happiness in the US over the last few decades
despite an approximately tenfold increase in real GDP and a fourfold
increase in real GDP per capita.</p>
<h4
id="more-holistic-economic-measurements-can-get-closer-to-capturing-what-we-value.">More
holistic economic measurements can get closer to capturing what we
value.</h4>
<p>Due to the disconnect between economic prosperity and true wellbeing,
some economists now propose the adoption of broader metrics. These new
measures aim to capture wellbeing more comprehensively, rather than
solely focussing on economic growth. One such measure is the Human
Development Index (HDI). The HDI comprises a nation’s average life
expectancy, education level, and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
(which is similar to GDP). Notably, the UN uses the logarithm of GNI per
capita in the HDI calculation, which accounts for the diminishing
returns of wealth: the idea that each additional dollar earned
contributes less to a person’s happiness than the one before it. In
general, economists consider a “report card” of indicators to assess a
nation’s wellbeing, rather than just depending on a single measure. By
capturing various aspects of wellbeing, this approach could provide a
more holistic and accurate representation of a nation’s quality of
life.</p>
<h4 id="summary.-1">Summary.</h4>
<p>Traditional economic measures and models are insufficient for
measuring and modeling what we care about. There is a disconnect between
what we measure and what we value; for instance, GDP fails to account
for essential unpaid labor and overvalues the production of goods and
services that add little to social wellbeing. While economic models are
useful, we must avoid relying too much on theoretically appealing models
and examine the matter of societal wellbeing with a more holistic
lens.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-the-economic-engine">Conclusions About the
Economic Engine</h3>
<p><em>AIs can drive competition, efficiency, and growth, creating
tangible benefits for everyone in society. However, they might
unintentionally create problems like inequality and reduce efficiency
and competition through market failures, highlighting the need for
regulation. Additionally, while it’s been a driver of prosperity in
human history, the economic engine is sometimes misaligned with
wellbeing, so it is not something to align AI development to.</em></p>
<h4
id="ais-will-likely-be-designed-to-achieve-objectives-other-than-social-wellbeing.">AIs
will likely be designed to achieve objectives other than social
wellbeing.</h4>
<p>Economic forces incentivize the development of AIs that prioritize
objectives such as financial gains for the companies deploying them,
rather than social wellbeing. Consider the pharmaceutical industry: the
primary goal of medicine is ideally to improve human health. Instead, in
a number of cases, pharmaceutical companies have fostered patient
dependencies on medications in order to ensure revenue and have used
patented information to raise prices to a point that many consumers
cannot afford life-saving drugs that cost little to produce. Similarly,
AI systems ostensibly designed to connect us to our friends, such as
social media algorithms, may instead result in users feeling
isolated.<p>
We must recognize such discrepancies in the context of AIs: AI systems
claiming to enhance happiness might not align with our best interests.
Perhaps a balance can be struck, where AIs continue to drive economic
growth, but not at the cost of other equally important aspects of
societal wellbeing. This disconnect between the goals of businesses
deploying AI systems and their users’ best interests underscores the
need for regulations that ensure that the deployment of AI does not
compromise societal wellbeing.</p>
<h4 id="we-should-be-wary-of-using-ai-to-increase-wellbeing.">We should
be wary of using AI to increase wellbeing.</h4>
<p>If policymakers trust AI to create policies intended to improve
society, they must be cautious about the objectives set for these
systems. Our current economic system strongly incentivises the
deployment of AI systems that optimize for economic growth rather than
other objectives. As we discussed, increasing economic output is often a
worthy goal, but may not capture essential aspects of societal health
such as equality, sustainability, or the smooth functioning of an
economy without market failures. While economic objectives like GDP
growth are quantifiable and easy to pursue, they may not truly reflect
what makes a society happy and healthy.</p>
<h4
id="it-is-risky-to-blindly-trust-the-economic-engine-to-create-ai-that-maximizes-our-wellbeing.">It
is risky to blindly trust the economic engine to create AI that
maximizes our wellbeing.</h4>
<p>Created as a result of businesses pursuing economic goals, AI systems
are not designed to maximize societal wellbeing. Instead, they are
geared towards wealth maximization for shareholders, with the potential
to supercharge economic efficiency and drive economic growth. If we let
the economy decide what AIs do by letting largely unregulated markets
create AIs, we will likely end up with an increase in inequality,
exacerbation of market failures, and promotion of economic goals like
wealth maximization that are notably different from increasing
wellbeing.<p>
Pursuing societal wealth maximization is not as good as maximizing
social welfare functions—discussed in the next section–—which account
for how individual wellbeing changes with wealth and how wellbeing is
distributed. The idea of using monetary equivalents as a proxy for
social value might seem practical, but it can distort societal
priorities; for instance, this system implies that the preferences of
wealthier individuals hold more weight since they are willing and able
to spend more. The preferences of a billionaire would be considered
orders of magnitude more important than those of an average citizen,
which is clearly disconnected from social value.<p>
The examples in this chapter demonstrate a divergence between economic
incentives and other important societal goals and should serve as a
cautionary note, encouraging us to remain wary of integrating AI
developed in line with economic incentives into all of our societal and
economic structures. Both the generation and distribution of wealth
matter, as well as how this wealth improves other aspects of social
wellbeing, such as crime rates and physical health. As we move forward,
we should take care to ensure that AIs’ potential is used to serve
humanity, not just the economy.<p>

    <p><span><b>A Note on Wellbeing in Social Science</b></span></p>
</legend>
Philosophers continue to debate what wellbeing is, or what it means to live a good
life. However, over the years, researchers have developed ways to
approximate wellbeing for practical purposes. Psychologists, economists,
philanthropists, policy makers, and other professionals need–—at
least–—a working definition of wellbeing in order to study, measure, and
promote it. Here, we describe some common views of wellbeing and
illustrate how they are used in social science.</p>
<h4 id="preference-satisfaction.">Preference satisfaction.</h4>
<p>Preference theorists view wellbeing as fulfilling desires or
satisfying preferences, even if doing so does not always induce
pleasure. Nonetheless, it remains an open question whether all desires
are tied to wellbeing or just certain kinds, like higher-order or
informed desires.<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> <em>Standard economics</em> often uses
preference satisfaction theories to study wellbeing. Revealed
preferences can be observed by studying the decisions people make. If
people desire higher incomes, for example, economists can promote
wellbeing by researching the impact of different economic policies on
gross domestic product (<em>GDP</em>).<p>
<strong>Social Surveys and Psychology.</strong> Traditionally,
psychological surveys evaluate wellbeing in terms of <em>life
satisfaction</em>. Life satisfaction is a measure of people’s stated
preferences—preferences or thoughts that individuals outwardly
express—regarding how their lives are going for them. Life satisfaction
surveys typically focus on tangible characteristics of people’s lives,
such as financial security, health, and personal achievements. They are
well suited to understanding the effects of concrete economic factors,
such as income and education, on an individual’s psychological
wellbeing. For example, to promote wellbeing, psychologists might
research the effects of access to education on one’s ability to achieve
the goals they set for themselves.</p>
<h4 id="hedonism.">Hedonism.</h4>
<p>Under hedonist theories of wellbeing, an individual’s wellbeing is
determined by their mental states. In particular, the balance of
positive mental states (like pleasure or happiness) over negative mental
states (like pain or suffering).<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> <em>Welfare economics</em> uses hedonism to
evaluate the wellbeing of populations. To estimate gross national
happiness (<em>GNH</em>)—-an indicator of national welfare—-it considers
the effects of several factors from psychological wellbeing to
ecological diversity and resilience on individuals’ mental states.
Welfare economists might prefer this framework because it is more
holistic - it evaluates both material and non-material aspects of
everyday life as they contribute to national welfare.<p>
<strong>Social Surveys and Psychology.</strong> Many psychologists also
use hedonist theories to understand and promote wellbeing. They may work
to identify the emotional correlates of happiness through surveys that
measure people’s stated emotions – unlike life satisfaction surveys,
these surveys do not reveal mental states. They reveal emotions that
people <em>remember</em>, not emotions they currently
<em>experience</em>. Researchers continue to look for ways to directly
observe emotions as they are experienced. For example, some studies use
cell phone apps to periodically prompt participants to record their
current emotions. Such research tactics may provide us with more precise
measures of individuals’ overall <em>happiness</em> by evaluating the
emotional responses to their everyday experiences in near real-time.</p>
<h4 id="objective-goods.">Objective goods.</h4>
<p>Under objective goods theories, wellbeing is determined by a certain
number of observable factors, independent of individuals’ preferences or
experiences. There are multiple theories about what those factors may
be. One of the most widely supported theories is <em>human
flourishing</em>. Under this view, wellbeing is more than just the
balance of pleasure over suffering, or the fulfillment of one’s
preferences – “the good life” should be full, virtuous, and meaningful,
encapsulating psychological, hedonistic, and social wellbeing all at
once.<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> In economics, the <em>capabilities
approach</em> defines wellbeing as having access to a set of
capabilities that allow one to live the kind of life they value. It
emphasizes two core ideas: <em>functionings</em> and
<em>capabilities</em>. Functionings include basic and complex human
needs, ranging from good health to meaningful relationships.
Capabilities refer to the ability people have to choose and achieve the
functionings they value – they may include being able to move freely or
participate in the political process. This approach has significantly
influenced human development indicators, such as the Human Development
Index (<em>HDI</em>) – it allows developmental economists to measure and
compare wellbeing across different populations while also evaluating the
effectiveness of public policies.<p>
<strong>Psychology.</strong> Positive psychologists do not collapse
wellbeing into one dimension, rather, they argue for a
<em>psychologically rich life</em> – one that is happy, meaningful, and
engaging. Some psychologists use <em>PERMA theory</em> to evaluate
psychological richness, which considers five categories essential to
human flourishing: 1) experience of <em>positive emotions</em>, 2)
<em>engagement</em> with one’s interests, 3) maintenance of personal,
professional, and social <em>relationships</em>, 4) the search for
<em>meaning</em> or purpose, and 5) <em>accomplishments</em>, or the
pursuit of one’s goals. This framework is particularly useful in
evaluating wellbeing because it is universal–—it can be applied
cross-culturally—-and practical—-it can guide interventions aiming to
improve emotional wellbeing, social relationships, or activities that
provide a sense of meaning or accomplishment.<p>
While we don’t have a complete understanding of the nature of wellbeing,
we can use these theories as useful research tools. They can help us to
(a) understand how different factors contribute to wellbeing and (b)
evaluate the effectiveness of policies and other interventions aimed at
improving wellbeing.</p>
