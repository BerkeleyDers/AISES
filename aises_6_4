<h1 id="sec:economic-engine">6.4 The Economic Engine</h1>
<strong>What
if we allow the economy to decide what AIs will be like?</strong>
Most AI systems today are being developed by businesses. We could therefore argue that AI development is most closely aligned with business or economic goals such as wealth maximization. 
Many believe this is good, arguing that the development of AIs should be guided by market forces that encourage innovations that may spur economic growth or extend human lifespans. 
Additionally, it seems increasingly likely that AIs will transform the economy by enabling new forms of business, changing the nature of work, and even displacing human workers. 
In this section, we will examine whether AIs shaped by economic incentives create the sort of society most people want. We examine both how the economy shapes the development of AI,
 and how AI might impact the economy.</p>
<strong>Business
goals influence the development of the most capable AI systems.</strong>
AIs are increasingly more efficient than humans at tasks once considered difficult to automate, which suggests that many powerful AI systems will be deployed to serve business objectives. 
This might be a cause for optimism: the economy, left to its own devices, often encourages efficiency and competition, creating lower costs and greater innovation. However, business-oriented
 AIs may focus narrowly on achieving specific financial goals, exacerbating inequalities, market externalities, and monopolies. <p>
Whether this is a reason for optimism or concern depends on to what
extent we think that the economy, left to its own devices, will produce
good outcomes. On one hand, AI has the potential to enhance efficiency
and foster competition, which can lower consumer costs and spur the
creation of innovative products. However, business-oriented AIs may
focus narrowly on achieving their specific goals, compromising values
such as community, personal freedom, privacy, and consumer choice. We
can draw from economics to examine how AI usage in business contexts
could either support or disrupt societal wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>By default, businesses are likely to prioritize using AI to maximize profits.</strong>
In a market system, businesses often prioritize maximizing profits
because the primary responsibility of company executives is to increase
value for shareholders. This concept, called shareholder primacy, has
been codified both implicitly and explicitly into American corporate law
<span class="citation" data-cites="lipton2019shareholder">[1]</span>. In
theory, corporations that explicitly prioritize other values such as
safety or social responsibility above profit in the long run can be sued
for neglecting their obligation to maximize shareholder value. While wealth creation is generally good, there are serious implications of prioritizing profit over all other values.</p>
<p>
Consider recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms. These AI
systems are designed to keep us engaged for as long as possible, thereby
increasing ad revenue and profit for the platform. Since these
algorithms prioritize viewer engagement over everything else, they may
recommend content that fuels addiction or spreads misinformation. In
other words, while these algorithms may be effective from a business
standpoint, they may have negative impacts on individuals and society at
large.</p>
<h2 id="the-free-market">6.4.1 The Free Market</h2>
<p>Under ideal circumstances, competitive economic markets drive efficiency and foster collective prosperity. Historically, market forces have led to specialization at a vast scale 
and worldwide competition, permitting the production of better goods and services at lower prices. The global economy is a complex system that allows for mass coordination. Prices, 
for instance, help producers and consumers reach equilibria in which they trade efficiently in the face of dynamic market conditions. One can speculate that the integration of AI 
into the economic engine could further optimize efficiency and enhance competition, ultimately contributing to accelerated economic growth and improved wellbeing. In this subsection,
 we will examine the case that AIs (developed under market incentives) can create widespread benefits by improving efficiency and growth.
</p>

<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>
<p><em>AIs can increase allocative efficiency, ensuring that outcomes
are efficient and contribute to social welfare.</em></p>
<strong>Under the right conditions, the free market can create allocative efficiency.</strong>
The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics states
that—subject to some strong assumptions—an equilibrium
<em>allocation</em> of goods reached by trading on a free market must be
<em>Pareto efficient</em>. An outcome is Pareto efficient if there is no
way to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off: any
change must trade off one person’s welfare against another. If the
allocation of goods were not Pareto efficient, then individuals within
it would trade in a way that exploited the possible Pareto improvement,
reaching a state in which no mutually beneficial trades can be
made.</p>
<p>This supports Adam Smith’s famous “Invisible Hand” argument, which
suggests that when individuals pursue their self-interest within a
market, they unintentionally contribute to societal welfare. By creating
gains from trade, there is an overall improvement in living standards
for everyone.</p>
<strong>There
are many conditions required for the invisible hand argument to
hold.</strong>
Without the following conditions, the invisible hand argument—which
holds that the presence of free markets with individuals acting in
self-interest can create outcomes that are Pareto efficient—would
fail.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>There must be an open market.</strong> There should be no
barriers to entry for producers or buyers, so that everyone can
participate in this market. This openness stimulates competition,
promoting economic efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There should be no seller big enough to move prices up
alone.</strong> If there are many sellers, then anyone who raises prices
will lose consumers. There must be no monopoly power: anyone with the
ability to raise prices without being forced down by competition will
create distortions that leave consumers worse off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No producer should privately hold a pivotal
technology.</strong> This means that other producers should be able to
copy the production of the first-mover. While the first-mover will make
profits in the short run, in the long run the market allocation will be
Pareto optimal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buyer should be big enough to move prices down
alone.</strong> Similar to the condition for producers, no buyer should
be big enough to force producers to take lower prices than others would
offer for them. Such buyers would create distortions that might, for
instance, force producers out of business, ultimately harming
everyone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There must be perfect information for everyone.</strong>
Producers and consumers must have access to perfect information, such as
about product quality and pricing. If consumers don’t know, for
instance, that a seller’s product is defective or that other sellers are
offering lower prices, then markets cannot achieve efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preferences must be non-satiated.</strong> The first
welfare theorem does not hold for all types of preferences; one
technical restriction is that consumers should always prefer more of a
good. If someone gains no further value from extra consumption, their
trading equilibria may not be Pareto efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There must be no externalities in consumption.</strong>
When one consumes a good, there must be no effect—positive or
negative—on anyone else. Second-hand smoke has a negative externality on
anyone nearby but this is unaccounted for in the price of cigarettes,
creating inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The state enforces property and contract laws.</strong>
Most economic theory assumes that contracts are enforceable, and that
individuals and corporations have protected property rights. Without
these, trading would be difficult to achieve and much more costly,
making it more difficult for everyone to achieve optimal
outcomes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the conditions for the invisible hand theorem always held, then we
might be more optimistic about AI’s role in enhancing social welfare. If
companies use AI to boost productive efficiency, lower costs, and
improve products, then these actions should eventually translate into
widespread advantages. Lower prices, improved products, and better
services could enhance consumer wellbeing, while increased efficiency
could stimulate economic growth. Later in this section, we will look at
market failures and inequality: two reasons why free trade is
insufficient to create social welfare. For now, we will focus on the
benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Competition
fosters productive efficiency and growth.</strong>
Markets continuously incentivize the lowering of prices and the
improvement of quality. Let’s imagine two grocery stores in a town. If
one store starts to offer lower prices, customers may flock to that
store, putting pressure on the other store to match those prices or risk
losing business. This encourages firms to be more <em>productively
efficient</em>–—to produce goods at lower costs–—so that they can lower
their prices while still making a profit. This competition can lead to
lower prices or higher quality products for consumers and more
attractive employment options for workers.</p>
<p>By leveraging AI, businesses can become more competitive by increasing
their productive efficiency. For example, many companies now use
AI-driven chatbots to handle customer service inquiries. These chatbots
can manage numerous queries simultaneously, around the clock, and
without human error, reducing the need for large customer service teams
and significantly reducing costs. AI can automate tasks that were
traditionally labor-intensive, leading to considerable savings.
Furthermore, AI can enhance decision-making processes. For instance,
companies can use AI to analyze large volumes of data and generate
insights about market trends, customer preferences, and operational
efficiencies. Such insights can inform strategic decisions, providing a
competitive advantage. Firms that do not leverage AI may find themselves
at a disadvantage, struggling to keep up with competitors that have
harnessed the power of AI to optimize their operations and enhance their
offerings.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p><em>AIs have the potential to drive economic growth, which can make
everyone better off without compromising value pluralism and improve
society across correlated domains like health, freedom, and
education.</em></p>
<strong>Growth
is widely considered essential to a healthy society.</strong>
Economic growth is an increase in the total value of the production
of goods and services. Such growth is a vital sign of a thriving
economy. An expanding economy usually indicates more wealth,
opportunities, and advancements, leading to overall improvements in
living standards. Growth plays a key role in sparking innovation and
entrepreneurship by creating incentives for companies to invest in ways
to accelerate production and additional funding available for research
and development. Growth encourages the creation of new ventures,
products, and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>We have
strong reasons for encouraging economic growth.</strong>
Looking at the world over the last 200 years provides strong evidence
that economic growth can lead to vast improvements in human life through
health, freedom, education, and more.<p>
</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 6.3: Increases in GDP per capita strongly correlate with increases in life expectancy.</p>
<!--<figcaption>Increases in GDP per capita strongly correlate with-->
<!--increases in life expectancy.</figcaption>-->
</figure>
<p>The Preston curve is compelling evidence of a positive correlation
between a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—a measure of
the total production of goods and services–—and health outcomes. This
relationship illustrates that countries with higher GDP per capita have
better health outcomes, and particularly that poorer countries stand to
benefit immensely from improvements in GDP. This also holds across time:
average global life expectancy was just below 40 years at the start of
the 20th century, whereas today, with a much higher global GDP per
capita, the average person expects to live for 70 years. Nobel laureate
Amartya Sen suggests that one pathway through which growth improves
health is by reducing poverty and increasing investments in healthcare
<span class="citation" data-cites="sen1999economics">[4]</span>.<p>
The benefits of economic growth extend beyond physical health. There is
a strong association between economic prosperity and enhancements in
freedom and education <span class="citation"
data-cites="heckelman2000economic">[5]</span>. Prosperous societies can 
afford stronger institutions to safeguard democratic freedoms and human rights. As societies become wealthier, more resources can be allocated to support cultural institutions, 
artists, and creative endeavors. Economic growth can enable Pareto improvements: changes that improve people’s lives without leaving anyone worse off, like growing a pie 
to give everyone bigger slices. Instead of debating whether to spend limited resources on a new hospital, school, or cultural center, encouraging economic growth can allow us to 
build all three. The increased wealth effectively allows us to accommodate multiple values, protecting value pluralism.</p>
<strong>Increasing growth through AI could yield massive benefits.</strong>
The effect of small increases in economic growth becomes apparent
when we consider the effects of compound growth over time. Even small
differences in annual growth rates can profoundly impact future
generations. For instance, if our economy grows at 1% per year, our
grandchildren will have twice our current income in 70 years. However,
if the economy grows at 2% per year, our children’s income in 35 years
would be double ours and our grandchildren’s income would quadruple.
Many believe that AIs could significantly accelerate the economy, creating unprecedented levels of economic growth. This could have hugely positive impacts on society. </p>

<p>While we've focussed on the potential benefits of efficiency and growth thus far, free markets do not always lead to good outcomes. 
Although growth is correlated with welfare, it can create serious inequalities if the benefits of growth are gained by a few. Unregulated markets do not always create efficient 
ones: instead, unregulated markets often see informational asymmetries, monopolies, and externalities. In the next section, we explore these problems in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="inequality-market-failures">6.4.2 Inequality &amp; Market
Failures</h2>
<p>The previous section on markets and efficiency painted a rosy picture
of real-world markets. In reality, we rarely see markets perform at this
ideal standard. Economic growth is often talked about as an intrinsic
good, but is only ever an instrumental one: it is not valuable for
itself, but for the positive effects it has on society. However, even
when markets are productively and allocatively efficient, creating
wealth for everyone, they might impose harmful side effects. Two reasons
for this are that markets generate <em>inequality</em> and are often
subject to <em>market failures</em>.<p>
First, we will explore the relevance of inequality in understanding
societal wellbeing, what tools can be used to measure its effects, and
why concerns about inequality are not just limited to those at the
bottom. Then, we will consider the potential implications of AI on
employment and income inequality, and how societies across the globe may
be impacted by an economy restructured by AI. We will also examine
various types of market failures: instances where markets fail to
allocate goods and services optimally. We will discuss information
asymmetries, the monopolistic power of large firms, and negative
externalities—consequences that extend beyond the direct participants of
a trade. All of these undermine the argument that an unregulated market
is sufficient for AIs to create widespread benefits for all.</p>
<h3 id="inequality">Inequality</h3>
<p><em>Inequality is on the rise and harms many people, including many
of those getting richer. The widespread use of AIs might sharpen
inequality, decreasing social wellbeing.</em></p>
<strong>Most of
the world exhibits high levels of inequality.</strong>
In economics, inequality refers to the uneven distribution of
economic resources, including income and living conditions. The <em>Gini
coefficient</em> is a commonly used statistical measure of income or
wealth distribution within a country. It is a number between 0 and 1,
where 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income or
wealth), and 1 signifies maximum inequality (one person has all the
income or wealth, and everyone else has none). Looking at Gini
coefficients, 71% of the world’s population lives in countries with
increasing inequality over the last thirty years <span class="citation"
data-cites="UN2020inequality">[6]</span>.</p>
<strong>Inequality
in the United States is particularly striking.</strong>
Figure 6.4 shows that the Gini coefficient in the
US has trended significantly upwards from 1969 to 2019. Over 50 years,
the pre-tax Gini coefficient has increased by 30%, while the post-tax
Gini coefficient has risen by 25%, suggesting that despite
redistributive taxation policies, the US income gap has widened
substantially. (For reference, this change in Gini coefficient is the
same size as moving from Canada to Saudi Arabia today. <span
class="citation" data-cites="UN2020inequality">[6]</span>) This increase
in the Gini coefficient is evidence of a growing inequality crisis. An
associated fall in social mobility—the ability of an individual to move
from the bottom income bracket to the top—cements inequalities over
generations.<p>
</p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 6.4: Inequality in the US (as measured by the Gini coefficient) has risen dramatically over the
last five decades, even adjusting for taxation. </p>
</figure>
<strong>The
distribution of gains from growth is highly unequal.</strong>
Nearly all the wealth gains over the past five decades have been
captured by the top 1% of income earners, while average
inflation-adjusted wages have barely increased <span class="citation"
data-cites="desilver2018workers">[7]</span>. A RAND Corporation working
paper estimated how the US income distribution would look today if
inequality was at the same level as in 1975—the results are in Table 6.1. Suppose my annual income is $15,000
today. If inequality was at the same level as in 1975, I would be paid
an extra $5,000. Someone else earning $65,000 today would instead have
been paid $100,000 had inequality held constant! We can see in the table
below that these increases in inequality have had massive effects on
individual incomes for everyone outside the top 1%.<p>

<strong>Inequality carries
serious implications.</strong>
For those worst off in an unequal society, the implications are
severe. Beyond obvious problems like an inability to access essentials
and maintain a basic standard of living, there are additional concerns
in domains like health. A widening wealth gap often corresponds with a
health gap, where those with fewer resources have poorer health outcomes
due to less access to quality healthcare, lower quality nutrition, and
higher stress levels. For instance, life expectancy often varies
dramatically based on income in unequal societies: the average life
expectancy of the lowest-income classes in America now matches the
averages in Sudan or Pakistan <span class="citation"
data-cites="wilkinson2009spirit">[9]</span>.</p>
<strong>Everyone,
not just the poorest, suffers in an unequal society.</strong>
One of the most robust findings is that unequal societies have higher
levels of crime <span class="citation"
data-cites="kelly2000inequality">[10]</span>. When inequality is high,
so too are levels of social tension, dissatisfaction, and shame, which
can contribute to higher crime rates. This can lead to a cycle where the
fear of crime drives further inequality, as wealthier individuals and
neighborhoods invest in measures that segregate them further from the
rest of society, further increasing inequality and crime rates. A more
detailed discussion of this relative deprivation can be found in the
section on Cooperation and Conflict. Inequality is also related to other
signs of societal sickness: worse physical and mental health, increased
drug use, and higher rates of incarceration. Strikingly, inequality is a
strong predictor of political instability and violence as well. While it
may seem like those with more wealth are insulated from the negative
effects of inequality, in reality they suffer indirect consequences as
well.<p>

<p class="tb-caption">Figure 6.6: Countries with higher income inequality tend to have higher rates of political instability.</p>
</figure>
<strong>The causes of inequality
are disputed.</strong>
Renowned economist Thomas Piketty, in his book “Capital in the 21st
Century,” posits that inequality results from the difference between the
interest rate investments in capital receive (r) and the rate of
economic growth (g) <span class="citation"
data-cites="piketty2014capital">[11]</span>. Essentially, when the
returns from investing wealth (r) surpass the overall growth rate (g),
society tends to become more unequal. This happens because the rich can
profit significantly from investing their existing wealth, while average
individuals cannot realize the same benefits from overall economic
growth. However, Piketty’s theory has met criticisms, especially when
considering its application to the future; for instance, he assumes that
the technological frontier can only grow at 1.5% per year, a limitation
that could potentially be overturned by advancements in AI.<p>
Many other theories seek to explain the rise in inequality. One
possibility is that an increased reward for technical skills has led to
a widening gap between those with high-skill jobs and those without.
Other theories point to the decline of labor unions, which traditionally
advocated for worker rights and better wages, as a contributing factor.
The driving forces behind rising inequality are undoubtedly
multifaceted, warranting a careful and nuanced examination.</p>
<strong>AI
might prompt higher returns on investments for the wealthy.</strong>
AI could significantly impact income inequality, intensifying
existing disparities. Investments in AI may yield higher productivity
compared to past opportunities, leading to a higher rate of return on
capital. Following Piketty’s theory of inequality, AI might exacerbate
inequality if it increases the capital return rate more than it
increases total growth if the wealthy can invest in AI more than
everyone else. This seems likely: those with existing capital (such as
GPUs) are likely to be able to deploy and benefit from AIs far more than
the average person. Additionally, the benefits from AIs might be
concentrated among the owners of AI companies, giving them astronomical
amounts of wealth rather than distributing these benefits widely.</p>
<strong>Automation using
AI might increase inequality.</strong>
If AIs are more productive than humans, as is likely to become the
case in many industries, automating human labor will increase profits
and returns on investment. Investors would likely opt for AI over human
labor since AI presents a more cost-effective and productive
alternative. A broad shift towards AI as a form of capital might prompt
the wealthy to invest more heavily in AI technologies than businesses
that rely on human labor. As businesses transition towards AI, the
demand for human labor may decrease, resulting in job losses. As a
result, workers’ bargaining power could be significantly reduced: a
surplus of labor could force wages down and weaken workers’ conditions,
benefits, and protections. If a job is automated, then conventional
bargaining tactics like striking are no longer an option. Such a
scenario would contribute to growing inequality and negatively impact
the livelihoods of workers.</p>
Although new technologies may create novel job opportunities, the
large-scale integration of AI could render many existing roles
redundant. Numerous job sectors are susceptible to replacement by AI.
Unlike in the past, even knowledge-based jobs such as writing and
programming are at risk due to advancements in AI such as large language
models, robotics, and computer vision. The advent of self-driving cars
could potentially displace the vast portion of the 5 million Americans
driving for a living. Similarly, advancements in robotics might threaten
the employment of the 12 million Americans working in manufacturing
<span class="citation" data-cites="yang2018war">[12]</span>. Since
software is cheap to duplicate, AI presents firms around the globe with
a low-cost and scalable alternative to using human labor. Mass
unemployment could result in severe inequality—establishing a divide
between the minority who own these transformative technologies and the
majority unable to find work.</p>
<strong>Past
revolutions have relocated employment, not destroyed it.</strong>
A common counterargument brought up in discussions about the
potential impact of AI on employment draws on historical evidence of
technological revolutions. Advocates of this view argue that while past
technological advancements–—like the industrial revolution or the
computer age–—did indeed displace certain jobs, they simultaneously
created entirely new types of work. Instead of an overall reduction in
employment, the nature of employment was transformed. This phenomenon,
called creative destruction, describes how outdated industries and jobs
are replaced by new, often more efficient ones.</p>
<strong>However,
human-level AI might destroy employment.</strong>
uman-level AI has the potential to automate tasks across most sectors in the long run. 
This could be through individual AIs excelling in specific tasks or an artificial general
 intelligence capable of doing it all. If we can automate any job inexpensively, it's unclear
 where humans would fit into the economy. This would represent a fundamental difference from 
past technological advancements that both helped and displaced human workers.</p>
<p><strong>The impacts of automation on employment are uncertain and could be delayed or offset by countervailing forces.</strong>
 It is unclear whether AIs will be able to automate any job inexpensively. We might create transformative AI systems that are nonetheless 
bad at some tasks, because of technical limitations or a simple preference for humans in a role (such as in the care industry). These bottlenecks
 would then become key industries for humans to work in. If the pace of automation is sufficiently slow, perhaps because AI capabilities do not 
increase uniformly or because they are limited by physical infrastructure like chip manufacturing, then the economy may be able to adapt relatively
 smoothly. Additionally, if automation creates dramatic increases in purchasing power due to decreasing prices of automated goods, then demand for
 human-provided goods and services may increase by enough that employment rates stay largely stable. </p>
<h3 id="market-failure">Market Failure</h3>
<p><em>AI development is aligned with the economic engine. We have argued that 
this may be good because the economy creates efficiency. However, in many cases, 
markets fail to deliver efficient outcomes. AIs may amplify or create these failures.</em></p
<strong>There
are a few common types of market failure that might concern us.</strong>
While markets are often efficient and usually yield better outcomes
than alternative methods like the allocation of resources by the
government, they are not perfectly suited to all types of trade.
Sometimes, when left to their own devices, markets often fail to
allocate resources in the most efficient way, leading to outcomes that
may be unfavorable from a societal standpoint, even if they appear to be
operating smoothly. These issues can be especially amplified in the
context of powerful AI systems. The chapter analyzes market failures
involving the overuse of common access resources like fish in the sea.
In this section, we consider three more common types of market failures
that are pertinent to our discussion about AI: <em>information
asymmetries</em>, <em>monopoly power</em>, and
<em>externalities</em>.</p>
<strong>Information
known to only some can create market failures.</strong>
Information asymmetry captures the idea that buyers and sellers have
different information regarding the product they are trading. For
instance, buyers are keenly aware of the product’s quality and
specifications, and sellers know their true willingness to pay for the
product. Information asymmetry isn’t inherently problematic and is, in
fact, often a positive aspect of market dynamics. We trust specialists
to provide valuable services in their respective fields; for instance,
we rely on our mechanics to know more about our car’s inner workings
than we do.<p>
However, issues arise when an imbalance of information is exploited
disingenuously. A classic example of this can be found in the used car
market. A dealer may be aware that a car’s axle is rapidly wearing out,
a defect that isn’t immediately noticeable to a potential buyer. By
withholding this information, the dealer could sell the car at a price
higher than its true value. The buyer, left in the dark, may end up
facing unexpected repair costs soon after purchase. This is also
referred to as <em>adverse selection</em>: when one party in a
transaction uses their access to private information to their advantage.
Here, the car dealer is using their private knowledge of the car’s
condition to make a sale at an unfair profit.</p>
<strong>AIs can cause
strong informational asymmetries.</strong>
AI holds the power to both create and exploit information asymmetries
in unprecedented ways. This capacity can be employed in beneficial ways,
like providing highly personalized services or excellent
recommendations. However, it can also be misused, leading to situations
in which those using AIs can manipulate consumers. AI-powered analytics
allows companies to create sophisticated profiles of consumers that can
uncover deep insights into individual personalities and behaviors. <span
class="citation" data-cites="rust2005psychometrics">[13]</span> Big tech
companies already use social media and device activity to understand an
individual’s preferences and vulnerabilities better than ever before.
This knowledge can be cunningly used to shape targeted advertisements or
manipulations that are hard for people to resist.</p>
<p>While AI magnifies the potential for information asymmetries, such
strategies have long standing precedents in non-AI contexts. Predatory
lending is a common practice where lenders, often equipped with more
information than borrowers, use deceptive practices to encourage
individuals into accepting unfair loan terms. These tactics tend to
target lower-income and less-educated individuals who might not have the
time or background to understand the fine-print of what they’re signing,
or the resources to find legal counsel. AI can further increase the
power imbalance; for instance, AI can be used to predict who is most
likely to accept these unfair loan terms based on their digital
behavior, leading to even more targeted predatory lending. AI can both
amplify existing issues and present new challenges.</p>
<strong>Markets can be monopolistic instead of perfectly competitive.</strong>
While competition can create productive efficiency, some firms can avoid competitive pressures; for example, utilities that are the exclusive provider of power or gas in a region might be able
to raise their prices without losing many consumers to competitors due to lack of alternatives. This ability is referred to as market control or monopoly power. When a single company or a small group of companies has a 
high level of control over a market, consumers are often left with limited product options and high prices. To prevent market control and preserve the benefits of competition, governments
 implement regulations such as antitrust laws, which they can use to prevent companies from obtaining too much control.</p>
<strong>High
initial investment requirements can impede newcomers from entering the
market.</strong>
Historically, first-movers in capital-intensive industries have a
competitive advantage, such as rail companies that own large quantities
of railway networks. In such industries, it is difficult for other firms
to enter the market due to high up-front costs; in many cases, an
existing firm can block other firms from entering, such as by keeping
prices below a sustainable level. AI development might be similar—at the
very least, firms within it might have some monopoly power that allows
them to avoid many competitive pressures.</p>
Developing a large model requires paying substantial fixed costs
up-front, including expenses for computing power and datasets essential
for training. However, once these initial investments are made, the
subsequent cost per user for deploying and maintaining these models is
considerably lower. Since the average cost per unit decreases as the
number of customers increases, it becomes substantially more
cost-effective for a single AI company to provide access to many people
than for multiple companies to independently develop and maintain
similar models.<p>
Additionally, only a few companies might have access to enough resources
and data to create the best AI models. In the chapter), we discussed how
scaling laws demonstrate that improving AI performance has required
access to costly resources like high-performance processors and vast,
high-quality datasets. High resource requirements for developing
advanced AI can limit market entry, stifling competition. Additionally,
early capability advantages for a leading firm can have positive
feedback loops and Matthew effect dynamics, which could enable them to
raise more capital and pull ahead of many competitors. The possibility
of monopoly power raises concerns that only a few powerful entities will
have access to and benefit from AI technologies.</p>
<strong>The use of AI might
create monopolies.</strong>
AI developers are striving to have their models achieve
superintelligence: models that are able to carry out a wide range of
tasks across various domains better than humans. If someone did manage
to create such an AI, they might have a decisive advantage across large
swathes of industry, being sufficiently versatile to become an expert in
many or every market. It may become difficult or impossible for smaller
firms to carve out niche market spaces. The advanced capabilities of
general AI may outpace specialized models in diverse domains, making it
more difficult for new entrants to gain market share. Large firms
equipped with powerful AI systems could wield an enormous amount of
power, potentially leading to less competition, higher prices, and
slower innovation, hurting both labor and product markets.</p>
<strong>Externalities
are consequences of economic activity that impact unrelated third
parties.</strong>
An externality is a side effect that stems from an economic activity,
impacting individuals or groups who are not directly involved in that
activity. Because of externalities, market prices for goods or services
may not fully reflect the costs that third parties, who are neither the
consumers nor the producers of that market, bear as a result of the
economic activity.<p>
A classic example of a negative externality–—a harm to a third party—is
the case of pollution. Consider the Sriracha factory in Irwindale,
California, where jalapeño peppers are ground and roasted. Residents of
Irwingdale claimed that odors from the factory caused lung and eye
irritation and created an overall unpleasant smell in the town. The
factory, by producing these odors, was imposing a negative externality
upon the town’s residents, but since the townspeople received no
automatic compensation for this inconvenience, this was not reflected in
the price of Sriracha.</p>
<strong>We
can resolve externalities with litigation, property rights, and
taxation.</strong>
In 2013, locals sued the Sriracha factory: this legal action led the
factory to install new filters to reduce pollution. Litigation can be an
effective tool to resolve externalities by forcing compensation.
Economic theory suggests that bargaining over the externality can also
create efficient outcomes; for instance, if the property right to the
air was understood to belong to the townspeople, and that the factory
would have to stop polluting or compensate the townspeople at an
acceptable rate for their inconvenience <span class="citation"
data-cites="lafleur2013coase">[14]</span>.<p>
A third commonly used resolution to externalities is taxation. Smoking
cigarettes imposes negative externalities on those near the smoker;
governments will thus impose taxes on the sale of tobacco, which both
raise revenues for the state to run social programs and discourage
smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes to better reflect its true
total cost. Determining the most effective method for resolving each
externality is a topic of ongoing debate among economists. Externalities
and their potential solutions provide crucial context when considering
the broader impacts of AI on society.</p>
<strong>The
development and deployment of AI systems can lead to negative
externalities.</strong>
The high energy consumption of advanced AI is a significant negative
externality on the environment. Training advanced AI models requires
vast computational resources, consuming a significant amount of energy
and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions can lead to
climate change, a cost borne by society at large, rather than only by
those who pollute. Another externality is related to data privacy. AI
systems require large volumes of data to learn and improve. People’s
privacy can be compromised if data is obtained without consent,
mishandled, misused, or leaked. Privacy breaches are costly to
individuals whose data is exposed, but this cost isn’t borne by
companies, who are rarely forced to compensate for damages.</p>
<strong>Summary.</strong>
We examined why inequality and market failures are primary concerns
in market systems and understood a few concrete pathways that these take
root. Unfortunately, AIs might exacerbate inequality, creating
disproportionate gains for the wealthy individuals and firms that create
it. AIs may also cause market failures by intensifying informational
asymmetries, enabling monopolies, and generating negative externalities
such as greenhouse gas emissions and violations of privacy. In the next
section, we will expand upon the idea that economic models fail to
capture many of the things we care about.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-economic-models">6.4.3 Beyond Economic Models</h2>
<p>In measuring societal wellbeing, we must recognize the shortcomings
of traditional economic metrics. Here, we will discuss the disconnect
between economic output and social value, why relying on economic models
of welfare economics can be inadequate in describing human goals, and
how more holistic measures of happiness and economic prosperity may give
us a clearer sense of true societal wellbeing.</p>
<h3 id="economic-output-and-gross-domestic-product">Economic Output and
Gross Domestic Product</h3>
<p><em>Economic output is only a proxy for what we care about;
maximizing it will often fail to maximize social wellbeing. Therefore,
AIs should not be given the objective of maximizing economic
output.</em></p>
<strong>Economic
indicators measure what we can quantify, not necessarily what we care
about.</strong>
Indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measure the monetary
value of final goods and services–—that is, those that are bought by the
final user–—produced in a country in a given period of time. When
economists discuss growth, they are typically referring to increases in
GDP. Measures of productive output like GDP are useful in gauging a
country’s economic health, but they fail to capture the value of
socially significant activities that aren’t priced in the market.</p>
<strong">Socially
important tasks are not captured by GDP.</strong>
Many essential roles in society, such as parenthood, community
service, and early education, are crucial to the wellbeing of
individuals and communities but are often undervalued or entirely
overlooked in GDP calculations <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2016gdp">[15]</span>. While their effects might be
captured–—education, for instance, will increase productivity, which
increases GDP–—the initial activity does not count. The reason is
simple: GDP only accounts for activities that have a market price.
Consequently, efforts expended in these socially important tasks,
despite their high intrinsic value, are not reflected in the GDP
figures.</p>
<strong>Technologies
that make our lives better may not be measured either.</strong>
Technological advancements and their resultant value often fail to be
reflected adequately in GDP figures. For instance, numerous open-source
projects like Wikipedia provide knowledge to internet users worldwide at
no cost. However, because there’s no direct monetary transaction
involved, the immense value they offer isn’t represented in GDP. The
same applies to user-generated content on platforms like YouTube, where
the main contribution to GDP is through advertisement revenue and most
creators aren’t compensated for the value they create. The value viewers
derive from such platforms vastly outstrips the revenue generated from
ads or sales on these platforms, but this is not reflected in GDP.</p>
<strong>There
might be a similar disconnect between GDP and the social value of
AI.</strong>
As artificial intelligence systems become more integrated into our
daily lives, the disconnect between GDP and social value might become
more pronounced. For example, an AI system that provides free education
resources may significantly improve learning outcomes for millions, but
its contribution would be largely invisible in GDP terms. Similarly, an
AI may substantially increase GDP by facilitating high-frequency trading
without doing much to increase social wellbeing. This growing chasm
between economic metrics and real value could lead to policy decisions
that fail to harness the full potential of AI or inadvertently hamper
its beneficial applications. Recognizing this gap is a vital step
towards devising better ways of measuring and encouraging the socially
beneficial use of AI.</p>
<strong>Increasing
output does not imply increasing social value.</strong>
The true costs of economic output can often be hidden or overlooked
in pursuit of growth. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
UNICEF estimates that 40,000 children work in cobalt mines, often in
hazardous conditions. While this labor may contribute to the country’s
economic output, the adverse effects on these children’s health and
education plausibly outweigh the short-term economic gains, and these
practices conflict with commonly held principles around the exploitation
of children. Much like in the high-frequency trading example above, more
output doesn’t necessarily correspond to increased social value. AIs
that maximize GDP as a proxy for social value may attempt high-frequency
trading or the use of exploitative labor practices, proxy gaming to
maximize its reward.<p>
Similarly, an increase in work hours could lead to heightened
productivity and output, but not necessarily enhanced societal
wellbeing. In the US, for example, workers highly value their leisure
time and often prioritize it over potential economic benefits of working
longer hours. In contrast, cultures with longer average work hours, such
as China, might have a different perspective on the balance between work
and leisure. Despite the country’s impressive economic growth in recent
decades, levels of self-reported happiness haven’t increased
proportionally, potentially due to growing income inequality <span
class="citation" data-cites="earterlin2012china">[16]</span>. Such
evidence suggests that an increase in output does not always translate
to an improvement in quality of life. We must consider factors beyond
economic metrics when assessing the societal impact of policies and
practices, particularly those involving AI systems. This perspective is
especially important when deploying AI systems that could significantly
influence the future of work.</p>
<strong>The financialization of
everything.</strong>
Another way in which economic output can be at odds with our values
is through the growing trend of financialization—monetizing various
aspects of private or public life <span class="citation"
data-cites="sandel2012money">[17]</span>. Increasingly, potent
algorithms are deployed to "optimize" life in various ways, with a
primary focus on profitability, sometimes at the expense of intrinsic
human values. These algorithms can distort the alignment between
technology and societal values. Consider aspects like love, friendship,
human rights, freedom, and environmental preservation. These are areas
we instinctively try to protect from the realm of commerce; for example,
people who sell friendship are often seen as degrading the value of
friendship. Unlike commodities that get depleted with use, altruism,
solidarity, and civic spirit can actually increase with use, much like
muscles that develop and become stronger when regularly used. These are
reasons we do not want to financialize virtues or many aspects of
life.<p>
However, economic incentives within markets often compel innovators to
monetize these aspects. Consider an experiment where a daycare center
imposed fines on parents who were late in picking up their children.
Instead of serving as a deterrent, the fine doubled the number of late
arrivals. Parents saw the fine not as a penalty, but as a service charge
for extended care, effectively absolving them of any guilt related to
tardiness. When the fine was eventually eliminated, the late pickups
didn’t decrease but rather increased. The financial penalty had
disappeared, but the original sense of guilt associated with late
pickups did not return <span class="citation"
data-cites="raworth2017doughnut">[18]</span>. This case demonstrates the
risk of allowing financialization into areas of life traditionally
governed by non-market norms; we might inadvertently erode the very
values we hold dear, like parental responsibility and respect for
others’ time.</p>
<strong>The
proxy-purpose distinction is especially important for AI.</strong>
Imagine a future where an AI system is tasked with maximizing GDP,
often seen as a proxy for wellbeing. The system could potentially
achieve this goal by promoting resource-intensive industries or
fostering a work culture that prioritizes productivity over wellbeing.
In such a scenario, the GDP might increase, but at the cost of essential
considerations like environmental sustainability and human happiness.
Therefore, relying solely on economic indicators could lead to decisions
that, while effective in the short term, might harm society in the long
run.<p>
Understanding the limitations of economic measurements is an important
step towards a safer use of AI. It helps us question what we should
optimize. The aim of economic policy should not just be to maximize
economic output but also to promote overall societal wellbeing. AI
systems may thus need to take into account multiple factors, like
equality, sustainability, and personal fulfillment, rather than only
economic indicators. Such an approach could pave the way for a future
where AI contributes positively to steering society without compromising
the values we hold dear.</p>
<h3 id="models-of-welfare-economics">Models of Welfare Economics</h3>
<p><em>Models of welfare economics try to maximize a quantity called
“social surplus.” While this sounds good, social surplus differs from
social wellbeing.</em></p>
<strong>The
most basic form of welfare economics maximizes social surplus.</strong>
<p>Social surplus is a measure of the total value created by a market:
it is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus. The
consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer
is willing to pay and the actual market price. Conversely, the producer
surplus is the difference between the actual market price and the
minimum price a producer is willing to accept for a product or service.
By maximizing the total surplus, welfare economics seeks to maximize the
social value created by a market.<p>
For instance, imagine a scenario where consumers are willing to pay up
to $20 for a book, but the market price is only $15. Here, the consumer
surplus is $5. Similarly, if a producer is willing to sell the book for
a minimum of $10, the producer surplus is $5. The social surplus, and
hence the social value in this market, is $10: $5 consumer surplus plus
$5 producer surplus.</p>
<strong>We should
be wary of generalizing from simple models.</strong>
The core model of welfare economics has its limitations. Notably,
welfare economics is concerned with the maximization of surplus, but is
indifferent to its distribution. This might not align with societal
notions of fairness and equality. For example, an AI optimized to
maximize profits might model consumers well enough to enable perfect
price discrimination: allowing firms to sell each good at exactly a
consumer’s maximum willingness to pay, converting all the consumer
surplus into producer surplus, but leaving the sum total of “social
surplus” unchanged.<p>
However, social surplus is not the only thing we care about. Since
utility functions with respect to money are concave, we care about how
rich consumers and producers are to begin with. If, as is usually the
case, consumers are poorer than the owners of a company, then
transferring $5 (of surplus) from consumers to producers decreases total
utility. The real gains for the firm may be small compared to the losses
for the consumers.<p>
As AI systems become more integral to our economies, we must be mindful
of these complexities. A narrow focus on maximizing economic surplus
could lead us to promote AIs which, while efficient in a purely economic
sense, might have alarming consequences for society.</p>
<strong>Basic
economic theory confuses ability with willingness to pay.</strong>
When determining social value, economic theory implicitly equates
ability to pay with willingness to pay. This assumption can lead to
distorted conclusions about what generates social value because these
two concepts should be distinct: ability to pay reflects an individual’s
financial capacity, while willingness to pay expresses their desire or
need for a good or service. The person who pays the most for a good is
not the person who values it the most.<p>
Consider a situation where both a billionaire and an average-income
individual require a life-saving drug. Both parties are willing to pay
whatever they can to obtain it. The billionaire is able to pay
astronomically more due to their wealth, despite the fact that the drug
provides the same life-saving value to both the billionaire and the
average-income person. The welfare economics model, in maximizing total
surplus, would interpret the billionaire’s purchase as creating a vastly
greater social value because the difference between the billionaire’s
purchase price and their willingness to pay is so great—an unsettling
conclusion that contradicts most moral perspectives.<p>
This disconnect is highlighted by differences between the developed and
developing world; those in the former have a relatively tiny ability to
pay. It seems unlikely that the preferences of someone in a wealthy
country are 100 times more intense than someone from the third world,
and yet their ability to pay is. It is similarly unlikely that Jeff
Bezos’s preferences are a million times more intense than the average US
citizen’s; yet, his ability to pay is. The economic engine is only
sensitive to ability to pay, not utility derived. As a result, the
market is distorted: individuals with astronomically high wealth are
prioritized astronomically, while those with nothing have no part to
play in the free markets’ allocation of value.</p>
<strong>Economics is not
fundamentally utilitarian.</strong>
The economic engine violates Bentham’s basic principle of
utilitarianism: “Everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one.”
Instead, people count for how much they can pay. In general, economics
is chiefly concerned with the efficient allocation of resources to help
satisfy people’s revealed economic preferences: what consumers and
producers are shown as willing to demand and supply at various prices.
However, revealed preferences about products are a narrow subset of
revealed preferences in general, and revealed economic preferences are
distinct from other sorts of preferences, such as idealized preferences.
Consequently, economics has differing objectives from theories like
preference utilitarianism that aim to maximize the satisfaction of
preferences in general. The economic engine is not a preference
maximization engine; instead, it is better thought of as a wealth
maximization engine. For example, although many people would welcome AIs
that aid education or assist medical research to benefit many, we may
just as soon see AIs that conduct highly effective subliminal marketing,
which may only benefit a few.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-in-economics">Happiness in Economics</h3>
<p><em>Economists are unsure what exactly creates happiness, but
material wealth is probably only one part of the picture.</em></p>
<strong>There
is a gap between human happiness and material prosperity.</strong>
Most people would agree that the goal of social sciences should not
be to just increase material wealth. A more meaningful aim would be to
enhance overall wellbeing or happiness. However, defining and measuring
happiness can be challenging. Whether happiness is correlated with
material wealth remains an ongoing research question; other aspects of
life like physical and mental health, job satisfaction, social
connections, and a sense of purpose seem important as well.</p>
<strong>Debates
about the Easterlin paradox highlight the complexity of understanding
happiness.</strong>
While wealthier people and countries are generally happier than their
less affluent counterparts, long-term economic growth does not always
correlate with long-term increases in happiness: this is the Easterlin
paradox. Several studies have tried to explore the relationship between
happiness and economic growth <span class="citation"
data-cites="earterlin2012china">[16]</span>. While some findings suggest
a correlation, others don’t, highlighting that our understanding of the
happiness-growth relationship is still evolving.<p>
We do, however, have strong evidence that inequality is unhelpful.
People often evaluate their wellbeing in relation to others; so, when
wealth distribution is unequal, people are dissatisfied and unhappy. For
instance, the recent rise in inequality may explain why there has been
no significant increase in happiness in the US over the last few decades
despite an approximately tenfold increase in real GDP and a fourfold
increase in real GDP per capita.</p>
<strong>More
holistic economic measurements can get closer to capturing what we
value.</strong>
Due to the disconnect between economic prosperity and true wellbeing,
some economists now propose the adoption of broader metrics. These new
measures aim to capture wellbeing more comprehensively, rather than
solely focussing on economic growth. One such measure is the Human
Development Index (HDI). The HDI comprises a nation’s average life
expectancy, education level, and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
(which is similar to GDP). Notably, the UN uses the logarithm of GNI per
capita in the HDI calculation, which accounts for the diminishing
returns of wealth: the idea that each additional dollar earned
contributes less to a person’s happiness than the one before it. In
general, economists consider a “report card” of indicators to assess a
nation’s wellbeing, rather than just depending on a single measure. By
capturing various aspects of wellbeing, this approach could provide a
more holistic and accurate representation of a nation’s quality of
life.</p>
<strong>Summary.</strong>
Traditional economic measures and models are insufficient for
measuring and modeling what we care about. There is a disconnect between
what we measure and what we value; for instance, GDP fails to account
for essential unpaid labor and overvalues the production of goods and
services that add little to social wellbeing. While economic models are
useful, we must avoid relying too much on theoretically appealing models
and examine the matter of societal wellbeing with a more holistic
lens.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-about-the-economic-engine">Conclusions About the
Economic Engine</h3>
<p><em>AIs can drive competition, efficiency, and growth, creating
tangible benefits for everyone in society. However, they might
unintentionally create problems like inequality and reduce efficiency
and competition through market failures, highlighting the need for
regulation. Additionally, while it’s been a driver of prosperity in
human history, the economic engine is sometimes misaligned with
wellbeing, so it is not something to align AI development to.</em></p>
<p><strong>AIs will likely be designed to achieve objectives other than social welfare.</strong> Economic forces incentivize the development of AIs that prioritize objectives such as financial gains for the companies deploying them, rather than social wellbeing. Consider the pharmaceutical industry: the primary goal of medicine is to improve human health. Instead, in a number of cases, pharmaceutical companies have fostered patient dependencies on medications in order to ensure revenue and have used patented information to raise prices to a point that many consumers cannot afford life-saving drugs that cost little to produce. Similarly, systems ostensibly designed to connect us to our friends, such as social media algorithms, may instead result in users feeling isolated.

<p><strong>We should be wary of using AI to increase metrics that are only proxies for wellbeing.</strong> Policymakers must be cautious about the objectives set for AI systems. Our current economic system strongly incentivises the deployment of AI systems that optimize for economic growth rather than other objectives. As we discussed, increasing economic output is often a worthy goal, but may not capture essential aspects of societal health such as equality, sustainability, or the smooth functioning of an economy without market failures. While economic objectives like GDP growth are quantifiable and easy to pursue, they may not truly reflect what makes a society happy and healthy.

<p><strong>It is risky to blindly trust the economic engine to create AIs.</strong> AI systems created by for-profit businesses are designed to maximize shareholder profits, not societal wellbeing. If we let the economy decide what AIs do by letting largely unregulated markets create AIs, we may end up with an increase in inequality, exacerbation of market failures, and promotion of economic goals like wealth maximization that are notably different from increasing wellbeing. Using money as a proxy for social value might seem practical, but it can distort societal priorities; for instance, this system implies that the preferences of wealthier individuals hold more weight since they are willing and able to spend more. The preferences of a billionaire would be considered orders of magnitude more important than those of an average citizen, which is clearly disconnected from social value. \\

<p>The examples in this section demonstrate a divergence between economic incentives and other important societal goals and should serve as a cautionary note. Objections to both the preference view of wellbeing and the influence of the economy on AI development suggest that we ultimately care about something else. In the next section, we consider an alternative view: a framework that puts happiness front and center. By instructing an AI system to increase happiness, we might aim to overcome the human biases and limitations that stop us from pursuing our happiness and enable the system to make decisions that have a positive impact on overall wellbeing.
