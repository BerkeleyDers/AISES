<p>It would not have been possible to complete a book of this scale on my own without spending several years on it. 
This would have significantly  reduced the book's value, given how urgent it is for us to understand and address important AI risks.
 I received invaluable support during the research, writing and editing process from various assistants, collaborators, and reviewers
 both at CAIS and externally that enabled me to complete this textbook in a more timely way.</p>
