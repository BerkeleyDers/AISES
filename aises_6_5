<h1 id="sec:wellbeing">6.5 Wellbeing</h1>
<p>In the next few sections, we will explore how AIs can be used to increase human wellbeing. We start by asking: what is wellbeing?</p>

<p><strong>Wellbeing can be defined as how well a person’s life is going for
them.</strong> It is commonly considered to be intrinsically good, and some think of wellbeing as the ultimate good. 
Utilitarianism, for instance, holds some form of wellbeing as the sole moral good.</p>

<p>There are different accounts of precisely what wellbeing is and how we can evaluate it. 
Generally, a person’s wellbeing seems to depend on the extent to which that person is happy, healthy, and fulfilled. 
Three common accounts of wellbeing characterize it as 1) net pleasure
over pain, 2) preference satisfaction, or 3) a collection of objective
goods. Each account is elaborated below.</p>

<h2 id="sec:pleasure">Wellbeing as the Net Balance of Pleasure over Pain</h2>
<p>Some philosophers, known as <em>hedonists</em>, argue that wellbeing
is the achievement of the greatest balance of pleasure and happiness
over pain and suffering. (For simplicity we do not distinguish, in this
chapter, between “pleasure” and “happiness” or between “pain” and
“suffering”). All else equal,
individuals who experience more pleasure have higher wellbeing and individuals who experience more pain have lower wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>According to hedonism, pleasure is the only intrinsic
good.</strong> Goods like health, knowledge, and love are instrumentally
valuable. That is, they are only good insofar as they lead to pleasure.
It may feel as though other activities are intrinsically valuable. For
instance, someone who loves literature may feel that studying classic
works is valuable for its own sake. Yet, if the literature lover were
confronted with proof that reading the classics makes them less happy
than they otherwise would be, they might no longer value studying
literature. Hedonists believe that when we think we value certain
activities, we actually value the pleasure they bring us, not the
activities themselves.<p>
Hedonism is a relatively clear and intuitive account of wellbeing. It
seems to apply equally to everyone. That is, while we all may have
different preferences and desires, pleasure seems to be universally
valued. However, some philosophers argue that hedonism is an incomplete
account of wellbeing. They argue there may be other factors that
influence wellbeing, such as the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="sec:preference-satisfaction">Wellbeing as Preference Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Some philosophers claim that what really matters for wellbeing is
that our preferences are satisfied, even if satisfying preferences does
not always lead to pleasurable experiences.<p>
One difficulty for preference-based theories is that there are different
kinds of preferences, and it’s unclear which ones matter. Preferences
can be split into three categories: stated preferences, revealed
preferences, and idealized preferences. If someone expresses a preference for eating healthy but never does, 
then their stated preference (eating healthy) diverges from their revealed preference (eating unhealthy). 
Suppose they would choose to eat healthy if fully informed of the costs and benefits: their idealized preferences, 
then, would be to eat healthy. Each of these categories can be informative in different contexts: we explore their relevance in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="sec:objective-goods">Wellbeing as a Collection of Objective Goods</h2>
<p>Others believe that wellbeing is the achievement of an objective set
of “goods” or “values.” These goods are considered necessary for living
a good life regardless of a person’s individual experiences or
preferences. 
<p><strong>There is disagreement about which particular goods are
necessary for wellbeing.</strong> Commonly proposed goods include happiness,
health, relationships, knowledge, and more. Objective goods theorists
consider these values to be important for wellbeing independently of
individual beliefs and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>One objection to the objective goods theory is that it’s elitist.</strong> The objective goods theory claims that some things are good for people even 
if they derive no pleasure or satisfaction from them. This claim might seem objectionably paternalistic; for instance, it seems condescending to claim that someone
 with little regard for aesthetic appreciation is thereby leading a deficient life. In response, objective goods theorists might claim that these additional goods 
do benefit people, but only if those people do in fact enjoy them.</p>
<p>There is no uncontroversial way to determine which goods are important
for living a good life. However, this uncertainty is not a unique
problem for objective goods theory. It can be difficult for hedonists to
explain why happiness is the only value that’s important for wellbeing, for instance.In the following sections we focus primarily on other interpretations of wellbeing
 and do not have space to discuss objective goods theory in depth, particularly given that there are many ways it can be specified.

<p>
Many AI researchers think that, for now, we should avoid accidentally
creating AIs that deserve rights <span class="citation"
data-cites="sebo2022chatbot">[1]</span>; for instance, perhaps all
entities that can experience suffering have natural rights to protect
them from it. Some think we should especially avoid giving them positive
rights; it might be fine to give them rights against being tortured but
not the right to vote. If they come to deserve rights, this would create
many complications and undermine our claim to control.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-for-an-action-to-be-right-or-wrong">7.3.3 What does
it mean for an action to be right or wrong?</h2>
<p>Some of the first questions we might ask about ethics are: Are all
actions either right or wrong? Are some simply neutral? Are there other
distinctions we might want to draw between the morality of different
actions?<p>
The answers to these questions, like most moral questions, are the
subject of much debate. Here, we will simply examine what it might mean
for an action to be right or wrong. We will also draw some other useful
distinctions, like the distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory
actions, and between permissible and impermissible actions. These
distinctions will be useful in the following section, when we discuss
the considerations that inform our moral judgments.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>Special obligations and constraints tell us what we should not do,
and sometimes, what we must do. Intrinsic goods tell us about things
that would be good, should they happen. But philosophers debate how much
good we are required to do.</p>

    <p><span><b>A Note on Wellbeing in Social Science</b></span></p>
</legend>
Philosophers continue to debate what wellbeing is, or what it means to live a good
life. However, over the years, researchers have developed ways to
approximate wellbeing for practical purposes. Psychologists, economists,
philanthropists, policy makers, and other professionals need–—at
least–—a working definition of wellbeing in order to study, measure, and
promote it. Here, we describe some common views of wellbeing and
illustrate how they are used in social science.</p>
<strong>Preference satisfaction.</strong>
Preference theorists view wellbeing as fulfilling desires or
satisfying preferences, even if doing so does not always induce
pleasure. Nonetheless, it remains an open question whether all desires
are tied to wellbeing or just certain kinds, like higher-order or
informed desires.<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> <em>Standard economics</em> often uses
preference satisfaction theories to study wellbeing. Revealed
preferences can be observed by studying the decisions people make. If
people desire higher incomes, for example, economists can promote
wellbeing by researching the impact of different economic policies on
gross domestic product (<em>GDP</em>).<p>
<strong>Social Surveys and Psychology.</strong> Traditionally,
psychological surveys evaluate wellbeing in terms of <em>life
satisfaction</em>. Life satisfaction is a measure of people’s stated
preferences—preferences or thoughts that individuals outwardly
express—regarding how their lives are going for them. Life satisfaction
surveys typically focus on tangible characteristics of people’s lives,
such as financial security, health, and personal achievements. They are
well suited to understanding the effects of concrete economic factors,
such as income and education, on an individual’s psychological
wellbeing. For example, to promote wellbeing, psychologists might
research the effects of access to education on one’s ability to achieve
the goals they set for themselves.</p>
<strong>Hedonism.</strong>
Under hedonist theories of wellbeing, an individual’s wellbeing is
determined by their mental states. In particular, the balance of
positive mental states (like pleasure or happiness) over negative mental
states (like pain or suffering).<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> <em>Welfare economics</em> uses hedonism to
evaluate the wellbeing of populations. To estimate gross national
happiness (<em>GNH</em>)—-an indicator of national welfare—-it considers
the effects of several factors from psychological wellbeing to
ecological diversity and resilience on individuals’ mental states.
Welfare economists might prefer this framework because it is more
holistic - it evaluates both material and non-material aspects of
everyday life as they contribute to national welfare.<p>
<strong>Social Surveys and Psychology.</strong> Many psychologists also
use hedonist theories to understand and promote wellbeing. They may work
to identify the emotional correlates of happiness through surveys that
measure people’s stated emotions – unlike life satisfaction surveys,
these surveys do not reveal mental states. They reveal emotions that
people <em>remember</em>, not emotions they currently
<em>experience</em>. Researchers continue to look for ways to directly
observe emotions as they are experienced. For example, some studies use
cell phone apps to periodically prompt participants to record their
current emotions. Such research tactics may provide us with more precise
measures of individuals’ overall <em>happiness</em> by evaluating the
emotional responses to their everyday experiences in near real-time.</p>
<strong>Objective goods.</strong>
Under objective goods theories, wellbeing is determined by a certain
number of observable factors, independent of individuals’ preferences or
experiences. There are multiple theories about what those factors may
be. One of the most widely supported theories is <em>human
flourishing</em>. Under this view, wellbeing is more than just the
balance of pleasure over suffering, or the fulfillment of one’s
preferences – “the good life” should be full, virtuous, and meaningful,
encapsulating psychological, hedonistic, and social wellbeing all at
once.<p>
<strong>Economics.</strong> In economics, the <em>capabilities
approach</em> defines wellbeing as having access to a set of
capabilities that allow one to live the kind of life they value. It
emphasizes two core ideas: <em>functionings</em> and
<em>capabilities</em>. Functionings include basic and complex human
needs, ranging from good health to meaningful relationships.
Capabilities refer to the ability people have to choose and achieve the
functionings they value – they may include being able to move freely or
participate in the political process. This approach has significantly
influenced human development indicators, such as the Human Development
Index (<em>HDI</em>) – it allows developmental economists to measure and
compare wellbeing across different populations while also evaluating the
effectiveness of public policies.<p>
<strong>Psychology.</strong> Positive psychologists do not collapse
wellbeing into one dimension, rather, they argue for a
<em>psychologically rich life</em> – one that is happy, meaningful, and
engaging. Some psychologists use <em>PERMA theory</em> to evaluate
psychological richness, which considers five categories essential to
human flourishing: 1) experience of <em>positive emotions</em>, 2)
<em>engagement</em> with one’s interests, 3) maintenance of personal,
professional, and social <em>relationships</em>, 4) the search for
<em>meaning</em> or purpose, and 5) <em>accomplishments</em>, or the
pursuit of one’s goals. This framework is particularly useful in
evaluating wellbeing because it is universal–—it can be applied
cross-culturally—-and practical—-it can guide interventions aiming to
improve emotional wellbeing, social relationships, or activities that
provide a sense of meaning or accomplishment.<p>
While we don’t have a complete understanding of the nature of wellbeing,
we can use these theories as useful research tools. They can help us to
(a) understand how different factors contribute to wellbeing and (b)
evaluate the effectiveness of policies and other interventions aimed at
improving wellbeing.</p>
</div>

<p>While people disagree about which account of wellbeing is correct, most people agree that wellbeing is an important moral consideration. All else equal, taking actions that promote wellbeing is generally considered morally superior to taking actions that reduce wellbeing. However, the three theories of wellbeing have different practical implications. In the future, we are likely to interact with AI chatbots in a variety of ways; in particular, we might have close personal interactions with them that influence our decision-making. Different theories of wellbeing would suggest different goals for these AIs.</p>

<p><strong>Chatbots could prioritize pleasure.</strong> The hedonistic view suggests that wellbeing is primarily about experiencing pleasure and avoiding pain. This theory might recommend that AIs should be providing users with entertaining content that brings them pleasure or encouraging them to make decisions that maximize their balance of pain over pleasure over the long run. A common criticism is that this trades off with other goods considered valuable like friendship and knowledge. While this is sometimes true, these goals can also align. Providing content that is psychologically rich and supports users’ personal growth can contribute to a more fulfilling and meaningful life full of genuinely pleasurable experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Chatbots could prioritize preference satisfaction.</strong> The preference view suggests that wellbeing is about having preferences satisfied. Depending on which preferences were considered important, this theory would suggest different priorities for a hedonistic chatbot. Consider revealed preferences. One proxy for revealed preferences is user engagement. By continuing to engage with a chatbot, users are expressing their preference for seeing more of what they are getting, and increasing preference satisfaction might imply continuing to behave in certain ways.</p>
<p>It is important to be careful of this equivalence, though: prioritizing user engagement can lead to results like chatbots that engage people through unsavory means. Like engaging humans, chatbots could try to addict users by showing them streams of ephemeral content, creating an air of mystery and uncertainty, or act distant after being friendly to create a desire for continued friendliness that it can then satisfy. Such AIs might maximize engagement, but this may not be good for people’s wellbeing—even if they use the platform for more hours.</p>
<p><strong>Chatbots could promote objective goods.</strong> The objective goods account suggests that wellbeing is about promoting goods such as achievement, relationships, knowledge, beauty, happiness, and the like. An AI chatbot might aim to enhance users’ lives by encouraging them to complete projects, develop their rational capacities, and facilitate learning. The goal would be to make users more virtuous and encourage them to strive for the best version of themselves. This aligns with Aristotle’s theory of friendship, which emphasizes the pursuit of shared virtues and mutual growth, suggesting that such AIs might have meaningful friendships with humans.</p>
<p><strong>We might want to promote the welfare of AIs.</strong> In the future, we might also come to view AIs as able to have wellbeing. This might depend on our understanding of wellbeing. An AI might have preferences but not experience pleasure, which would mean it could have wellbeing according to preference satisfaction theorists but not hedonists. Future AIs may have wellbeing according to all three accounts of wellbeing. This would potentially require that we dramatically reassess our relationship with AIs.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will focus on the different conceptions of wellbeing presented here, and explore what each theory implies about how we should embed ethics into AIs.</p>

<p><span><b>A Note on Measuring Wellbeing</b></span></p>
</legend>
While the philosophical
foundations of wellbeing are not settled, quantitative research fields
like public health and economics require the use of metrics in order to
evaluate, track, or compare the subject of study. Researchers use many
different metrics to measure wellbeing, but the most common are HALYs
and WELBYs.</p>
<strong>Health-adjusted life years
(HALYs).</strong>
A very common unit for measuring wellbeing is the health-adjusted
life year, or HALY. HALYs account for two factors: (1) the number of
years lived by an individual, group, or population (also called “life
years”), and (2) the health of those life years. Two common types of
HALYs are QALYs and DALYs.</p>
<strong>Quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs).</strong>
QALYs measure the number of years lived, adjusted according to
health. One year of life in perfect health is equivalent to 1 QALY. One
year of a less healthy life is worth between 0 and 1 QALYs. The value of
a life year depends on how severely the life is impacted by health
problems. For example, a year of life with asthma might be worth 0.9
QALYs, while a year of life with a missing limb might be worth about 0.7
QALYs.</p>
<strong>Disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs).</strong>
While QALYs measure years of life as impacted by health, DALYs
measure years of life lost, accounting for the impact of health. Whereas
1 QALY is equivalent to a year in perfect health, 1 DALY is equivalent
to the loss of a year in perfect health. A year of life with asthma
might be worth 0.1 DALYs, while a year of life with a missing limb might
be worth 0.3 DALYs.<p>
Note that increases in wellbeing are indicated by higher numbers of
QALYs but lower numbers of DALYs.<p>
Using HALYs to measure wellbeing has some limitations. First, the extent
to which different illnesses or injuries affect overall human health is
not clear. Losing a limb probably has a larger health impact than
getting asthma, but researchers must rely on subjective judgements to
assign precise values to each problem. Second—and perhaps more
importantly—HALYs measure the value of a span of life as it is impacted
by health alone. In reality, there are many factors that can impact the
value of life, like happiness, relationship quality, freedom, and a
sense of purpose. Perhaps a more useful measurement of wellbeing would
consider the effects of all of these factors, rather than health
alone.</p>
<strong>Wellbeing-adjusted life
years (WELBYs).</strong>
WELBYs have been developed to measure years of life as impacted by
overall wellbeing. One WELBY is equivalent to one year of life at
maximum wellbeing — namely, a life that is going as well as possible.
Wellbeing can be assessed using self-reported outcomes like affect, life
satisfaction, or degree of flourishing. There may also be some empirical
ways to assess wellbeing like cortisol levels, income, or ability.</p>
QALYs, DALYs, and WELBYs provide different approximations of wellbeing
that can be used to inform high-level decision-making and
policy-setting.</p>
