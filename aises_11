<p>It would not have been possible to complete a book of this scale on
my own without spending several years on it, by which point it might
have come out too late to help readers to understand and address
important AI risks. To avoid this issue, I worked with various
contributors to complete this tegittbook in a more timely manner. With a
handful of exceptions, I was responsible for deciding the contents of
the chapters, sections, and subsections and developed a detailed
paragraph-level outline for these, as well as providing multiple rounds
of feedback and revisions. The other contributors to this textbook wrote
the bulk of the content and helped to organize, expound on, and
explicate these ideas clearly. I would like to acknowledge the following
contributors for each chapter:</p>

<li><p><strong></strong> with Anna Swanson, Jeremy Hadfield, Adam
Elwood, and Corin Katzke</p></li>
<li><p><strong></strong> with Jesse Hoogland, Adam Khoja, Thomas
Woodside, Abra Ganz, Aidan Oâ€™Gara, Spencer Becker-Kahn, Jeremy Hadfield,
and Joshua Clymer</p></li>

philosophy fellows, and the participants in our AI Safety Sprint Course
