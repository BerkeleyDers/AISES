<h1 id="fairness"> 6.3 Fairness</h1>
<h3 id="introduction-1"> Introduction</h3>
<p>We have discussed how bias in AI systems can cause harm. AI is being
used in many sensitive applications that affect human lives, from
lending and employment to healthcare and criminal justice. As a result,
unfair AI systems can cause serious harm. Methods for improving AI
fairness could mitigate these harms, but they require overcoming
challenges in formalizing and implementing fairness. This section
explores algorithmic fairness, including its technical definitions,
limitations, and real-world strategies for building fairer systems.</p>
<h4 id="the-compas-case-study.">The COMPAS case study.</h4>
<p>A famous example of algorithmic decision-making in criminal justice
is the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for
Alternative Sanctions) software used by over 100 jurisdictions in the US
justice system. This algorithm uses observed features such as criminal
history to predict recidivism, or how likely defendants are to reoffend.
A ProPublica report <span class="citation"
data-cites="angwin2016bias"></span> showed that COMPAS
disproportionately labeled African-Americans as higher risk than white
counterparts with nearly identical offense histories. However, COMPAS’s
creators argued that it was <em>calibrated</em>, with accurate general
probabilities of recidivism across the three general risk levels, and
that it was less biased and better than human judgments <span
class="citation" data-cites="dieterich2016compas"></span>. This
demonstrated the trade-off between different definitions of fairness: it
was calibrated across risk levels, but it was also clear that COMPAS
generated more false positives for African-American defendants
(predicting they would re-offend when they did not) and more false
negatives for white defendants, predicting they would not re-offend when
they in fact did. Adding to the concern, COMPAS is a black-box
algorithm: its process is proprietary and hidden. One lawsuit argued
this violates due process rights since its methods are hidden from the
court and the defendants <span class="citation"
data-cites="harvard2017state"></span>. In this section, we will discuss
some of the serious ethical questions raised by this case, examining
what makes algorithms unfair and considering some methods to improve
fairness.</p>
<h2 id="ai-fairness-concepts"> 6.3.1 AI Fairness Concepts</h2>
<h4 id="fairness-is-difficult-to-specify.">Fairness is difficult to
specify.</h4>
<p>Fairness is a complicated and disputed concept with no single
agreed-upon definition. Different notions of fairness can come into
conflict, making it challenging to ensure that an AI system will be
considered fair by all stakeholders.</p>
<h4 id="five-fairness-concepts.">Five fairness concepts.</h4>
<p>Some concepts of <em>individual fairness</em> focus on treating
similar individuals similarly—for instance, ensuring job applicants with
the same qualifications have similar chances of being shortlisted.
Others focus on <em>group fairness</em>: ensuring that protected groups
receive similar outcomes as majority groups. <em>Procedural
fairness</em> emphasizes improving the processes that lead to outcomes,
making sure they are consistent and transparent. <em>Distributive
fairness</em> concerns the equal distribution of resources.
<em>Counterfactual fairness</em> emphasizes that a model is fair if its
predictions are the same even if a protected characteristic like race
were different, all else being equal. These concepts can all be useful
in different contexts.</p>
<h4 id="justice-as-fairness.">Justice as fairness.</h4>
<p>Ethics is useful for analyzing the idea of fairness. John Rawls’
theory of justice as fairness argues that fairness is fundamental to
achieving a more just social system. In the chapter , we explore his
<em>maximin</em> and <em>difference principles</em>, which state that
inequalities in social goods can only be justified if they maximize
benefits for the most disadvantaged people. He also argued that the
social goods must be open to all under equality of opportunity. These
ideas align with common notions of fairness. Some argue this principle
also applies to AI: harms from the bias of algorithmic decisions should
be minimized, especially in ways that make the worst-off people better
off. Theories of justice can help develop the background principles for
fairness.</p>
<h4 id="algorithmic-fairness.">Algorithmic fairness.</h4>
<p>The field of algorithmic fairness aims to understand and address
unfairness issues that can arise in algorithmic systems, such as
classifiers and predictive models. This field’s goal is to ensure that
algorithms do not perpetuate disadvantages based on <em>protected
characteristics</em> such as race, gender, or class, especially while
predicting an outcome from features based on training data. Several
different technical definitions of fairness have been proposed, often
formalized mathematically. These definitions aim to highlight unfairness
in ML systems, but most possess inherent limitations. We will review
three definitions below.<br />
<em>Statistical parity.</em> The concept of statistical parity, also
known as demographic parity, requires that an algorithm makes positive
decisions at an equal rate for different groups. This metric requires
that the model’s predictions are <em>independent</em> of the sensitive
attribute. A hiring algorithm satisfies statistical parity if the hiring
rates for men and women are identical. While intuitive, statistical
parity is a very simplistic notion; for instance, it does not account
for potential differences between groups that could justify or explain
different outcomes.<br />
<em>Equalized odds.</em> Equalized odds demands that the false positive
rate and false negative rate are equal across different groups. A
predictive health screening algorithm fulfills equalized odds if the
false positive rate is identical for men and women. This metric ensures
that the <em>accuracy</em> of the model is not dependent on the
sensitive attribute value. However, enforcing equalized odds can reduce
overall accuracy.<br />
<em>Calibration.</em> Calibration measures how well predicted
probabilities match empirical results. In a calibrated model, the actual
long-run frequency of positives in the real population will match the
predicted probability from the model. For instance, if the model
predicts 20% of a certain group will default on a loan, roughly 20% will
in fact default. Importantly, calibration is a metric for populations,
and it does not tell us about the correctness or fairness of an ML
system for individuals. Calibration can improve fairness by preventing
incorrect, discriminatory predictions. As it happens, ML models often
train on losses that encourage calibration, and are therefore often
calibrated naturally.<br />
These technical concepts can be useful for operationalizing fairness.
However, there is no single mathematical definition of fairness that
matches everyone’s complex social expectations. This is a problem
because satisfying one definition can often violate others: there are
tensions between statistical notions of fairness.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-fairness"> 6.3.2 Limitations of Fairness</h2>
<p>There are several problems with trying to create fair AI systems.
While we can try to improve models’ adherence to the many metrics of
fairness, the three classic definitions of fairness are mathematically
contradictory for most applications. Additionally, improving fairness is
often at odds with accuracy. Another practical problem is that creating
fair systems means different things across different areas of
applications, such as healthcare and justice, and different stakeholders
within each area have different views on what constitutes fairness.</p>
<h4 id="contradictions-between-fairness-metrics.">Contradictions between
fairness metrics.</h4>
<p>Early AI fairness research largely focused on three metrics of
fairness: statistical/demographic parity, equalized odds, and
calibration. However, these ubiquitous metrics often contradict each
other: statistical parity only considers overall prediction rates, not
accuracy, while equalized odds focuses on accuracy across groups and
calibration emphasizes correct probability estimates on average.
Achieving calibration may require violating statistical parity when the
characteristic being predicted is different across groups, such as
re-offending upon release from prison being more common among
disadvantaged minorities <span class="citation"
data-cites="corbettdavies2018measure"></span>. This makes fulfilling all
three notions of fairness at once difficult or impossible.<br />
The <em>impossibility theorem</em> for AI fairness proves that no
classifier can satisfy these three definitions of fairness unless the
prevalence of the target characteristic is equal across groups or
prediction is perfect <span class="citation"
data-cites="chouldechova2016fair kleinberg2016inherent"></span>.
Requiring a model to be “fair” according to one metric may actually
disadvantage certain groups according to another metric. This undermines
attempts to create a universally applicable, precise definition of
fairness. However, we can still use metrics to better approximate our
ideals of fairness while remaining aware of their limitations.</p>
<h4
id="fairness-can-reduce-performance-if-not-achieved-carefully.">Fairness
can reduce performance if not achieved carefully.</h4>
<p>Enforcing fairness constraints often reduces model accuracy. Two
papers found that applying fairness techniques to an e-commerce
recommendation system increased financial costs <span class="citation"
data-cites="zahn2009cost"></span> and mitigating unfairness in Kaggle
models by post-processing reduced performance <span class="citation"
data-cites="biswas2020machine"></span>. However, these and others also
find ways to simultaneously improve both fairness and accuracy; for
example, work on healthcare models has managed to improve fairness with
little effect on accuracy <span class="citation"
data-cites="poulain2023improving"></span>. While aiming for fairness can
reduce model accuracy in many cases, sometimes fairness can be improved
without harming accuracy.</p>
<h4
id="difficulties-in-achieving-fairness-across-contexts.">Difficulties in
achieving fairness across contexts.</h4>
<p>Different fields have distinct problems: fairness criteria that make
sense in the context of employment may be inapplicable in healthcare.
Even different fields within healthcare face different problems with
incompatible solutions. These context-specific issues make generic
solutions inadequate. Models trained on historical data might reflect
historical patterns such as the underprescription of pain medication to
women <span class="citation"
data-cites="calderone1990influence"></span>. Removing gender information
from the dataset seems like an obvious way to avoid this problem.
However, this does not always work and can even be counterproductive.
For instance, removing gender data from an algorithm that matches
donated organs to people in need of transplants failed to eliminate
unfairness, because implicit markers of gender like body size and
creatinine levels still put women at a disadvantage <span
class="citation" data-cites="rodriguez-castro2014female"></span>.
Diagnostic systems without information about patients’ sex tend to
mispredict disease in females because they are trained mostly on data
from males <span class="citation" data-cites="Straw2022"></span>.
Finding ways to achieve fairness is difficult: there is no single method
or definition of fairness that straightforwardly translates into fair
outcomes for all.</p>
<h4 id="disagreements-in-intuitions-about-fairness.">Disagreements in
intuitions about fairness.</h4>
<p>There is widespread disagreement in intuitions about the fairness of
ML systems, even when a model fulfills technical fairness metrics; for
instance, patients and doctors often disagree on what constitutes
fairness. People often view identical decisions as more unfair if they
come from a statistical model <span class="citation"
data-cites="lee2018understanding"></span>; they also often disagree on
which fairness-oriented features are the most important <span
class="citation" data-cites="harrison2020emperical"></span>, such as
whether race should be used by the model or whether the model’s accuracy
or false positive rates are more important. It is unclear how to define
fairness in a generally acceptable way.</p>
<h2 id="approaches-to-improving-fairness"> 6.3.3 Approaches to Improving
Fairness</h2>
<p>Due to the impossibility theorem and inconsistent and competing
ideas, it is only possible to pursue some <em>definition</em> or
<em>metric</em> of fairness—fairness as conceptualized in a particular
way. There are two fundamental and complementary ways to approach this
more limited goal: technical approaches that focus directly on
algorithmic systems, and <em>social approaches</em> that focus on
related social factors.</p>
<h4 id="technical-approaches.">Technical approaches.</h4>
<p>Metrics of fairness such as statistical parity identify aspects of ML
systems that are relevant for fairness. Technical approaches to
improving fairness include a host of methods to improve models’
performance on these metrics, which can mitigate some forms of
unfairness. These often benefit from being broadly applicable with
little domain-specific knowledge. Developers can test predictive models
against various metrics for fairness and adjust models so that they
perform better. Fairness toolkits offer programmatic methods for
implementing technical fairness metrics into ML pipelines. Other methods
for uncovering hidden sources of unfairness in ML models include audits,
adversarial testing, sensitivity analysis, and ranking feature
importances.</p>
<h4 id="problems-with-technical-approaches.">Problems with technical
approaches.</h4>
<p>However, technical methods fall short of addressing the social
consequences of unfairness. They fail to adjust to sociocultural
contexts and struggle to combat biases inherited from training data.
“Fairness through unawareness” aims to remove protected characteristics
like gender and race from datasets to prevent sexism and racism, but
fails miserably in practice because this data is embedded in correlates
[as we explored in the Bias section in chapter]. A focus on narrow
measures can ignore other relevant considerations, and measures are
often subject to proxy gaming <a href="#sec:proxy-gaming"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:proxy-gaming">[sec:proxy-gaming]</a>. A more
in-depth, qualitative, and socially grounded approach is often harder
and does not scale as easily as technical methods, but it is still
essential for navigating concerns in AI fairness.</p>
<h4 id="social-approaches.">Social approaches.</h4>
<p>Social approaches emphasize that unfairness is tied to systemic
social injustices propagated through technical systems. They highlight
political, economic, and cultural factors and apply methods such as
anti-discrimination policy, legal reform, and a design process focused
on values and human impacts. These methods, which include policies like
developing AI systems with input from stakeholders, can surface and
mitigate sources of unfairness early. Substantive social changes are
generally more expensive and difficult than technical approaches.
However, they can be more impactful, reducing models’ negative social
impacts.</p>
<h4 id="frameworks-for-fairness.">Frameworks for fairness.</h4>
<p>Ongoing research aims to create frameworks for AI fairness that blend
technical and social considerations. <em>Fair deployment</em> frameworks
focus on gradually deploying AI while assessing its impacts, ensuring
there are strong oversight mechanisms and independent audits, and
establishing methods to redress any harm. Audits can promote an
understanding of the data sources and decision-making processes of ML
models. This transparency is helpful but insufficient, as we saw in the
chapter <a href="#sec:opaqueness" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:opaqueness">[sec:opaqueness]</a>. <em>Participatory
design</em> frameworks involve all of the impacted communities in the
development of AI systems to surface unfairness early and ensure the
product meets diverse human needs. Other frameworks focus on how
hierarchies and distributions of power can intersect to produce
unfairness or evaluating how AI affects the least advantaged in society.
These broad frameworks recognize that effective solutions require
combining technical interventions with social and legal policies to
address underlying social factors.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Technical definitions of fairness are useful tools, but improving the
fairness of AI necessitates broader approaches. There are inherent
tradeoffs between fairness criteria which means that satisfying all the
popular definitions of fairness is logically impossible. Additionally,
satisfying some mathematical definitions does not guarantee fair
outcomes anyway. Developing fair AIs might require broader
sociotechnical solutions such as the participation of stakeholders in
deciding the tradeoffs a model makes between various fairness criteria.
Research on algorithmic fairness continues to influence how AI systems
are built and used. In the next section, we will examine how AI systems
are currently being built and used, discussing the Economic Engine that
creates and shapes AIs, and might in turn be transformed by them.</p>
