stakes</h2>
<p><strong>Individual stakes to common stakes overview.</strong> The
Nobel laureate economist John Harsanyi suggested a concept like the veil
of ignorance to explore how we should structure our societies. Behind
the veil of ignorance, agents are unaware of their personal
characteristics and roles in society. This forces them to act as
impartial observers when envisioning how the group or society should
interact with each other. (For a more detailed discussion of the veil of
ignorance, see <em>Section of the chapter</em>: A Brief Introduction).
Because agents do not know what place they will hold (e.g., whether they
will get an average position in society or a different position) in the
society they envision, they often act more impartially and cooperatively
when constructing a group or society. When rational agents are ignorant
of their future position in society—when they are forced to make
decisions behind the veil of ignorance—they are more likely to make
decisions that maximize collective wellbeing, enabling cooperation
through the mechanism of <em>individual stakes to common stakes</em>

<p><strong>Natural examples of individual stakes to common
stakes.</strong> Intragenomic conflict arises when an individual
organism’s genes have differing interests with respect to their
transmission to the next generation. For example, some genes may have
evolved mechanisms that increase their own replication at the expense of
the organism’s wellbeing. The process of meiosis, however, can resolve
the problem of intragenomic conflict through randomization or the
creation of a “Darwinian veil of ignorance.” Meiosis is a process of
cell division that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells in
sexually reproducing organisms. Meiosis typically results in a 50-50
distribution of genetic material from both parents to offspring,
fostering genetic diversity. While it would be “better” for any
individual gene to make more copies of itself in offspring, it cannot
“know” whether doing so will actually increase the fitness of the
organism, allowing it to pass on its genes to subsequent generations.
However, by fostering genetic diversity, the process of meiosis opens
the door to randomized success, allowing the forces of natural selection
to impartially dictate which genes and their respective traits propagate

<p><strong>Individual stakes to common stakes in human society.</strong>
The “Hutterites” are a religious group known for their cooperative and
communal lifestyle <span class="citation"
data-cites="Harsanyi1955CardinalWI Dennett1995DarwinsDI">[3],
[4]</span>. They represent a prime example of how the mechanism of
individual stakes to common stakes can be used to promote cooperation.
Within their communities, the Hutterites distribute all resources among
themselves, and relinquish any personal wealth or possessions. This
allows the Hutterites to live under a collective identity, where focus
on the common good often overrides individual interests. As another
example, when their group gets too large, Hutterites set up another
place for people to live, and once it is finished, they randomly select
members from their community to go live there. Alternatively, consider a
scenario in which a group of people must row to shore. The ship does not
have enough food for everyone, so the group will have to throw some
rowers overboard at the halfway point to ensure the rest of the group’s
survival. However, no one in the group knows that they may be thrown
overboard, but they do know that to make it to shore, they must all row
now. If people knew that they would be thrown overboard at some point,
they would be far less likely to row.</p>
<p><strong>Individual stakes to common stakes and AIs.</strong> People
might perceive advanced future AIs as an outgroup threat, and this may
motivate humans to cooperate against AIs. As AI’s become more widespread
and powerful, they may begin to threaten human values at the global
scale, motivating nations—for instance, the US and China—to set aside
their differences and come together to address a common threat. If AI is
someday viewed by humanity as an “invasive species,” it may promote
global solidarity.</p>
<h2 id="simons-selection-mechanism">Simon’s Selection Mechanism</h2>
<p><strong>Simon’s selection mechanism overview.</strong> Humans and
other animals typically do not have access to all available information,
time, and cognitive abilities required to make the best possible
decision. Individuals are restricted by their “bounded rationality.” To
overcome their bounded rationality and arrive at better solutions,
people and organisms can benefit, on average, from relying on and
receiving information through cooperative social channels. Individuals
that take advantage of cooperative social channels have an increased
ability to acquire socially transmitted skills and conform to socially
established norms, thereby incurring a fitness advantage over those that
do not participate in such channels. Moreover, when individuals choose
to contribute to cooperative social channels, the information they
provide can be freely utilized by anyone who participates in the system.
If this information is widely used and benefits the entire social
structure, social norms may emerge that compel others participating in
the cooperative social channel to conform their behavior appropriately.
In other words, when individuals participate in cooperative social
channels, they may benefit from the collective intelligence they
provide, but they may also face a cost from the group which can
influence their behaviors through norms or rules. This idea was
pioneered by the political scientist and Nobel laureate, Herbert Simon,
and we refer to it as <strong>Simon’s selection mechanism</strong> <span
class="citation" data-cites="simon1990mechanism">[5]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Simon’s selection mechanism in human society.</strong> Humans
have a tendency to believe in facts and propositions that they have not
had the opportunity to independently verify. Such knowledge is typically
disseminated through established cooperative social channels, such as
the internet or culture. For instance, many people believe that
consuming too much of certain kinds of cholesterol is bad for one’s
health, or that touching a hot stove should always be avoided. People
generally agree upon these beliefs not because they are skilled medical
literature reviewers or seasoned chefs, but because such beliefs have
become socially transmitted common knowledge. In general, people are
better off being a part of society, rather than isolating themselves
from it. Societal isolation may prevent individuals from accessing
critical information that is disseminated through social channels. For
instance, a hermit living in the woods with no internet access might be
unaware that there is steadily expanding forest fire in the
vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Simon’s selection mechanism and free riding.</strong> One
drawback of Simon’s selection mechanism is that it may enable free
riding. Individuals may benefit from the information contained in
cooperative social channels without themselves contributing to it.
Consider the open-source knowledge base, Wikipedia, in this respect.
Though anyone can, in theory, contribute to Wikipedia, few people
actually do, because doing so can require extensive time and effort.
This can result in a knowledge base that has much outdated content.</p>
<p><strong>Simon’s selection mechanism and AIs.</strong> In a
multi-agent setting, AIs may be interacting with one another directly.
They may create new communication channels and protocols among
themselves, and from their interactions, norms and information channels
may emerge. Such dynamics can give rise to very complex social systems
from which AIs are more able to benefit than humans are. In other words,
AIs may incur fitness advantages over humans by developing and
participating in their own cooperative social channels, which themselves
may preclude human understanding. Moreover, such cooperative social
channels may evolve into AI collective intelligences, just as the
internet now represents a form of human collective intelligence.
However, within these collective intelligences, AIs could maintain large
numbers of complex relationships with other AIs simultaneously, arriving
at potentially new forms of self-organization that increase AIs ability
to achieve their goals. AI collective intelligences would be vastly
superior to human collective intelligences, and as a consequence, humans
may be prevented from participating in and understanding the decisions
AIs make within such systems.</p>
