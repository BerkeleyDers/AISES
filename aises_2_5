<h3 id="introduction-4">Introduction</h3>
<p>This section provides a high-level overview of reinforcement learning
(RL). We introduce the basic structure and vocabulary of RL problems and
explore how RL is used.<br />
Reinforcement learning techniques attempt to automate the capacity for
an agent to learn from its actions and their consequences in an
environment <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sutton2018 kaelbling1996reinforcement"></span>. This is
distinct from other ML problems, where a system can learn from an
existing dataset. Instead, an RL system (or <em>agent</em>) learns the
hard way, collecting data through experience. An RL agent must learn how
to explore different possible actions to attain as much reward as
possible. Reward measures the agent’s progress towards its goal and acts
as feedback in the learning process.<br />
Reinforcement learning takes its approach from how animals and humans
learn to interact with the world. If someone puts their hand on a hot
stove, the resulting pain is a significant negative reward, making them
unlikely to repeat the same behavior. As intelligent agents, we learn
through the way the world responds to our actions. We mostly try to
pursue good outcomes, defined by their positive rewards, and avoid bad
outcomes, which lead to negative rewards. In this way, teaching
automated systems through RL is similar to training a dog. When a dog
performs the desired behavior, such as rolling over on command, its
trainers might reward it with a treat. The trainers repeat this process
as the dog gradually refines its behavior to perform as they
desire.<br />
RL techniques have been involved in recent successes in AI. In 2017,
DeepMind’s AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a world
champion in Go, a game long considered the most challenging classical
game for AI <span class="citation"
data-cites="silver2016masteringgo"></span>. In 2020, an RL agent
developed in less than a year by a small Maryland company won a clear
victory over an Air Force pilot in simulated one-on-one combat. RL
techniques have been most successful in smaller-scale and less realistic
environments, such as video games, where a very accurate simulated
environment is readily available. However, games can also be designed to
represent real-world environments.</p>
<h2
id="learning-sequential-decision-making-through-trial-and-error"> 2.5.1 Learning
Sequential Decision Making through Trial and Error</h2>
<p><strong>Trial and error.</strong> All RL problems involve an agent
learning by trial and error to make sequences of decisions. RL agents
usually start without prior knowledge of the environment. Over time, the
agent accumulates information about its environment and uses it to make
better decisions. An agent might learn that bumping into walls
constantly does not lead to good outcomes and avoid the walls to find a
viable path.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential decision making.</strong> Making sequential
decisions effectively is essential to achieving complicated, long-term
goals. Accomplishing such goals requires not only that prudent actions
are taken but also that they are taken in an appropriate order. To an
agent, it is often unclear how one action may impact later actions, but
what it does will affect the future and must be modeled. Since decisions
are sequential in RL tasks, RL agents might be better suited to
achieving complicated, long-term goals.<br />
RL agents can also learn to navigate uncertainty. An agent may not know
if a particular choice is good or bad, and the world may change (on its
own or in response to its choices), but the agent must act regardless. A
self-driving car navigating a busy intersection must sequence its
actions–—accelerate, brake, or turn–—based on the positions and speeds
of other vehicles, and its current actions will affect these other parts
of the environment. To tackle these difficulties, some RL agents are
designed to learn from their interactions to develop a sophisticated
understanding of their environments to plan their actions.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence modeling.</strong> Sequential decision making (SDM)
is a subtype of the general <em>sequence modeling</em> task, which
involves analyzing and predicting patterns in ordered data. In RL, this
data is predominantly in the form of observations of the environment
over time. The RL system learns to make decisions based on this
information, considering its knowledge of the environment, uncertainty
about the world, and past choices.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing RL.</strong> Reinforcement learning differs
from supervised and unsupervised learning. A key difference between
these paradigms is how the ML system obtains information. Supervised and
unsupervised learning tasks learn efficient and useful representations
on fixed, precompiled datasets. Supervised learning goes about this
directly: learning by example. Unsupervised learning addresses similar
problems with less guidance, uncovering the latent patterns in unlabeled
data without being explicitly told whether it is right or wrong. It is
akin to solving a puzzle without seeing the picture on the box. By
contrast, RL systems must acquire new information through actions. They
receive almost no data at the outset and learn to achieve a goal by
actively engaging with an environment and seeing what happens.</p>
<h2 id="the-reinforcement-learning-problem"> 2.5.2 The Reinforcement Learning
Problem</h2>
<p>We can use two toy examples to introduce the central concepts and
terms of reinforcement learning. First, we consider the multi-armed
bandit—a classic reinforcement learning problem—starting with a simple
situation and gradually adding complications to build up to a full
reinforcement learning problem. Next, we use a Gridworld problem to
introduce the agent-environment loop, a framework for understanding
reinforcement learning problems. Finally, we discuss policies: the
decisions that RL agents make.</p>
<h3 id="multi-armed-bandits">Multi-Armed Bandits</h3>
<p>In casino lingo, “one-armed bandits” refers to slot machines, which
have a single lever that takes people’s money. Playing a slot machine is
not a reinforcement learning problem because there is only one possible
action with a random outcome. However, suppose there is a slot machine
with two or more levers. Then, a gambler must decide which lever to pull
every time they play. Assuming the levers affect the device differently,
one lever might win them more over the long run (such as over 500
pulls). How does one decide which levers to pull and in what order? This
problem is called the <em>multi-armed bandit</em> problem.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration-exploitation trade-off.</strong> Multi-armed
bandit problems exemplify a dilemma at the heart of reinforcement
learning: the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. RL agents
must choose between exploring actions with high uncertainty and
exploiting actions with a high expected reward. In a multi-armed bandit
problem, the agent starts without knowing anything about the expected
reward of any given lever. Therefore, the first thing it has to do is
gain information about the levers. Trying different actions with
uncertain rewards is called <em>exploration</em>. By contrast, taking
actions with a high expected value is called <em>exploitation</em>. In
this phase, the agent chooses the actions it expects to yield the
highest rewards based on its current understanding of the
environment.<br />
Balancing this trade-off between exploration and exploitation is crucial
to the success of an RL agent. If the agent explores too much, it might
waste resources on low payoff actions or even stumble into actions with
negative payoffs. Conversely, if the agent exploits too early, it might
settle for suboptimal actions, missing out on potential higher rewards.
The challenge lies in determining when and how to shift between
exploration and exploitation to maximize the overall benefit. A series
of possible strategies aim to make this trade-off, with varying degrees
of sophistication; in the following, we outline two simple examples.</p>
<p><strong>Greedy strategies.</strong> First, the agent pulls each lever
once and records the payoff it receives from each pull. Then, it pulls
whichever lever initially resulted in the highest payoff, which it
continues to pull as many times as possible. This is a greedy strategy
because the agent only tries each lever once and exploits from then on.
However, the problem with a greedy strategy is that the agent cannot be
sure that the lever it settles on actually has the highest expected
utility.</p>
<p><strong>Epsilon-greedy strategies.</strong> After pulling each lever
once, an agent might decide to keep exploring as well. One thing it
could so is pull the lever it currently thinks has the highest expected
payoff 95% of the time and pull a random lever the other 5% of the time.
This is called an epsilon-greedy strategy, where “epsilon” refers to the
small probability of pulling a random lever. Epsilon-greedy is a much
better strategy than greedy if there are enough pulls ahead of the
agent, since the agent will figure out which lever is best to pull over
time. After enough pulls, the agent will pull the most profitable lever
95% of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Adding context to the bandit problem.</strong> So far, the
best lever to pull is always the same and the agent just has to figure
out which one it is. However, suppose each lever has two payoff
distributions: one for when a light on the slot machine is green, and
one for when the light is red. The best lever to pull now depends on the
context (the color of the light), which varies randomly. In this
environment, the agent needs to take the context into account when it
chooses a lever to pull. This is called a <em>contextual multi-armed
bandit</em> problem.</p>
<p><strong>Adding interaction to the bandit problem.</strong> Suppose
further that the light on the slot machine doesn’t vary randomly, but
instead changes according to which lever the agent pulls. For example,
it might turn green after the second lever is pulled or red if once both
levers have been pulled twice. It might be better for the agent to pull
a lever with a lower expected payoff at the moment, but will change the
context such that the agent can access a greater total profit in the
long run. Therefore, the agent needs to be able to estimate expected
payoffs over single actions and sequences of actions.</p>
<h3 id="the-full-reinforcement-learning-problem">The Full Reinforcement
Learning Problem</h3>
<p>The problem we face now is to come up with a strategy that tells the
agent (1) which lever to pull, (2) in varying contexts, and (3) taking
into account that its actions can affect that context. The bandit
problem is now a <em>full reinforcement learning problem</em>.<br />

<p>The strategies we considered above—–<em>greedy</em> and
<em>epsilon-greedy</em>–—aren’t suitable anymore. To develop better
strategies, we’ll need more terms and concepts. In particular, we’ll
introduce the agent-environment loop as a more technical framework for
RL. We’ll also replace our example: instead of the multi-armed bandit,
we’ll use a problem called Gridworld.</p>
<p><strong>Gridworld.</strong> In Gridworld, an agent learns to find a
particular cell (the goal) in its environment (a two-dimensional grid)
while avoiding other cells (hazards). The agent can move into any
adjacent open cell. Moving into an open cell is neutral, moving into a
hazard is very bad, and moving into the goal is very good.<br />
</p>

reinforcement learning.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>The agent-environment loop.</strong> The relationship between
an RL agent and its environment can be described by the
<em>agent-environment loop</em>. At each <em>time step</em> in this
loop, the agent takes some <em>action</em> which affects the
<em>environment</em>. Then, the agent receives a <em>reward signal</em>
and a state observation from the environment. Using Gridworld as our
example, we discuss each of those terms below.<br />
</p>
<figure id="fig:agent-environment">
<img src="images/ML_background/image36.png" />
<figcaption>The agent-environment loop - from <span class="citation"
data-cites="wikipedia-markov"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong><em>Environment and state</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The environment and state are the world.</strong> In
Gridworld, the agent is located on a particular cell and can move to
adjacent cells. The environment includes the grid itself, its
boundaries, the location of the agent, and anything the agent may
encounter. When the environment changes (such as when the Gridworld
agent moves), we say that its state changes. A state observation is the
information (other than reward) an agent receives from the environment.
In Gridworld, an observation might be the agent’s position as well as
the positions of the goal, hazards, and barriers. At each time step, the
state of the environment updates, and the agent takes a snapshot
observation of the available information in the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Environments can be fully or partially observable.</strong>
When an agent can observe all of the information in its environment, we
say that the environment is <em>fully observable</em>. In contrast, when
an agent can only observe some of the information about the state of the
environment, we say that the environment is <em>partially
observable</em>. The environment in chess is fully observable because
all of the information about the state of the game is available to both
players. By contrast, the environment of a poker game is only partially
observable: players do not know other players’ cards. Our example,
Gridworld, is fully observable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Actions and action spaces</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Agents choose actions from their action space.</strong>
Agents affect their environment by taking actions. At each time step,
they choose an action from the set of all actions available to them.
This set is called the <em>action space</em>. In Gridworld, the agent
takes an action from the action space that describes each possible move
to an unoccupied adjacent cell. The agent cannot move into a space
occupied by a barrier or outside of the dimensions of the grid.</p>
<p><strong>Action spaces can be continuous or discrete.</strong> A
<em>discrete</em> action space describes a finite number of possible
actions. The action space of our Gridworld agent is discrete—at most,
consisting of up, down, left, and right. The same is true for the action
space of a multi-armed bandit agent, which consists of a finite number
of levers available to pull. In contrast, a <em>continuous</em> action
space, such as possible directions of movement in a real
three-dimensional space, has infinitely many possible actions.</p>
<p><strong>Agents get rewards.</strong> At each time step, agents
receive a reward from the environment. This reward is represented by a
number, which can be positive, negative, or zero. (This means that, in
contrast to the everyday use of the word “reward,” a reward can be a bad
outcome.) The agent in Gridworld might receive a reward of 10 for
finding the goal, <span class="math inline"> − 10</span> for
encountering a hazard, and 0 otherwise. In this case, encountering a
danger cancels out the reward from achieving the goal, so hazards should
always be avoided. However, exploring neutral squares is free, so this
can be done as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards are often discounted.</strong> In general, an RL
agent’s goal is to maximize the sum of rewards it receives over the long
term. Sometimes, though, we want an agent to value short-term rewards
more than long-term rewards, such as encouraging agents to behave in a
more risk-averse way or to account for their uncertainty. In these
cases, we multiply future rewards by a <em>discount factor</em> (<span
class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span>), and the agent maximizes the
<em>discounted</em> long-term reward. If the reward at time <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, the
discounted long-term reward is: <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> + <em>γ</em><sup>1</sup><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub> + <em>γ</em><sup>2</sup><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em> + 2</sub> + ... + <em>γ</em><sup><em>n</em></sup><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em> + <em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards are designed to suit the problem.</strong> The
process of creating the right rewards for an RL problem is called
<em>reward shaping</em>. In Gridworld, we might want the agent to find
the goal more quickly rather than take a long, roundabout path. To
encourage this, we could use rewards to incentivize speed or,
equivalently, penalize slowness. If the default reward is 0 when the
agent does not encounter the goal or a hazard, reaching the goal in a
few time steps would be rewarded the same as reaching the goal in 1,000
time steps. However, if we change this reward to <span
class="math inline"> − 1</span>, the agent has an incentive to reach the
goal more quickly.</p>
<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>
<p>An RL agent’s <em>policy</em> (often denoted <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>) gives an action for each possible
state observation. In simple environments, one can think of a policy as
a two-column matrix, where the first column lists all possible state
observations, and the second column lists each corresponding action. The
strategies we described in the context of the multi-armed bandit
problem—greedy and epsilon-greedy—are examples of policies an agent
could use when the environment has a single state. In the contextual
multi-armed bandit problem, we added a second state. A policy over two
states might look like: “If green, pull lever X; if red, pull lever
Y.”</p>
<p><strong>Policies can be deterministic or stochastic.</strong> A
<em>deterministic policy</em> assumes that all actions are taken with
certainty. In the bandit problem, the <em>greedy</em> strategy is a
deterministic policy. In Gridworld, a deterministic policy may be to
always move to the right or to follow a particular path to the goal. In
contrast, a <em>stochastic policy</em> assumes that actions are taken
with some randomness, such as randomizing between pulling different
levers when following an <em>epsilon-greedy</em> strategy. In Gridworld,
a stochastic policy might be to choose randomly among actions for the
first few time steps.</p>
<p><strong>Optimal policies.</strong> An optimal policy is a policy
that, if followed, maximizes the sum of (discounted) rewards. In
Gridworld, the optimal policy would describe the shortest route to the
goal from any starting location. In more complex problems, however,
computing the optimal policy is often intractable. For example, in
chess, an optimal policy would need to give the best move in all <span
class="math inline"> ∼ 10<sup>45</sup></span> possible board positions.
However, approximating the optimal policy has still produced RL chess
agents that far surpass the human level of play.</p>
<p>This section introduced the agent-environment loop as a technical
framework for talking about reinforcement learning problems. In place of
the “strategies” we considered in the multi-armed bandit problem, we
introduced the idea of a policy, which gives an action at each time step
according to the agent’s observation of its environment. In Gridworld,
we could manually define a policy for the agent to follow–—but that
would defeat the purpose of the problem, which is to have the agent
learn for itself. The next section explores how reinforcement learning
algorithms automate designing policies.</p>
<h2 id="methods-for-solving-rl-problems"> 2.5.3 Methods for Solving RL
Problems</h2>
<p><strong>RL algorithms develop better policies.</strong> RL algorithms
serve as the blueprints to guide the learning process, aiming to
discover the optimal strategy for the agent in its environment. While
all RL algorithms share a common theme of learning through trial and
error—exploring the environment, observing the results, and adjusting
behavior based on rewards and penalties—their unique characteristics
arise from the specific approach they take toward learning. Specific RL
algorithms are distinguished by how or what their agent learns.</p>
<p><strong>Model-based vs Model-free RL.</strong> We can organize
different RL algorithms into two broad approaches based on their
computational learning strategies: <em>model-based</em> and
<em>model-free</em>. In <em>model-based</em> RL algorithms, the agent
constructs an internal model of its environment. The agent learns how
its world operates and represents cause-and-effect relationships, using
this model to predict the outcomes of actions and optimize its behavior.
An RL agent playing chess could develop a model of the game,
representing the rules and understanding that specific configurations
win the game. It can use this model to plan its moves, simulating
different sequences to anticipate their results before making a move.
Model-based methods are most applicable to problems in environments with
easily representable dynamics.<br />
In contrast, <em>model-free</em> RL methods learn directly from
experience without explicitly modeling the underlying mechanics of the
environment. Instead, the agent develops associations between actions
and rewards. These simple associations serve as a kind of “intuition”
for projecting what actions lead to the most reward in given situations.
Consider an RL agent learning to play Pac-Man: it does not comprehend
the game’s design or the ghosts’ behavior. Instead, through trial and
error, it learns strategies like “eating a power pellet and then chasing
ghosts leads to high scores.” The AI uses these associations, rather
than an internal model of the game, to guide its future actions.
Model-free approaches are often best for problems where the
environment’s dynamics are complex or unknown and abundant data is
available for learning.</p>
<p><strong>Policy-based vs Value-based RL.</strong> Another distinction
is how an RL agent represents what is “good” in its environment,
learning how good states or actions are, how good policies are, or both
at the same time. In <em>policy-based</em> RL methods, the agent focuses
on learning an effective policy: a set of rules guiding its actions in
response to different states. Rather than calculating the value of each
state or action, the agent optimizes the policy based on the observed
rewards of its actions. The agent may pursue an action because it is
part of a good policy without knowing exactly how good the action itself
is. An RL agent learning how to balance a pole on a cart for a robotics
task does not explicitly calculate the value of different pole angles or
cart positions. Instead, it adjusts its policy—how it responds to
various states—to optimize for the goal of keeping the pole balanced. It
might learn the policy “if the pole tilts to the right, move the cart to
the right.” This approach is often best for handling continuous action
spaces but struggles with finding the optimal policy in large or complex
environments due to the vast number of potential policies.<br />
Conversely, <em>value-based</em> RL methods prioritize learning the
value of different states or actions within the environment. The agent
evaluates and ranks states or actions based on their potential to yield
rewards, selecting the ones with the highest estimated reward. An RL
agent playing tic-tac-toe evaluates each move’s value (putting a mark in
an empty cell) based on the likelihood of that move leading to a win and
chooses the action with the best outcome. The agent learns to take
actions that maximize the cumulative reward over time without specifying
a policy.</p>
<p><strong>An agent’s value function estimates the expected reward of a
state or state-action pair.</strong> Internally, an agent might estimate
how good or bad certain states are. The agent learns a <em>value
function</em> to keep track of these estimates, which it can use to
estimate the returns of different actions. Value functions can also
estimate how well a policy performs in the long run by calculating the
expected cumulative reward of following a policy over time. An agent in
Gridworld could learn a value function to estimate the reward of moving
into a particular space. Alternatively, an RL agent in a car’s GPS might
use a value function to estimate the value of different routes based on
the expected travel time.<br />
</p>
<figure id="fig:value-methods">
<img src="images/ML_background/two-types-method.png" />
<figcaption>Two value-based methods: state-value and action-value (Q-)
functions - <span class="citation" data-cites="huggingface"></span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Value functions can focus on the value of a state or an
action.</strong> There are two main types of value functions in
reinforcement learning: <em>state-value functions</em> and
<strong>action-value functions</strong>. A state-value function (<span
class="math inline"><em>V</em><sup><em>π</em></sup>(<em>s</em>)</span>)
estimates the expected cumulative reward that an agent will receive when
starting from a state <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and
following a policy <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>. We can
estimate the <em>state values</em> of each location in Gridworld,
assuming the agent follows a random policy. In every area, the agent
moves to a random adjacent open cell, repeating this process until it
bumps into the goal or a hazard. The state-values of cells near the goal
are higher than those far away from the goal and much higher than those
near the hazard. The state-value function for this policy gives us an
estimate of how likely it is that the agent will reach the goal or hit a
hazard from each cell.<br />
An action-value function <span
class="math inline">(<em>Q</em><sup><em>π</em></sup>(<em>s</em>,<em>a</em>))</span>
estimates the expected cumulative reward that an agent will receive by
taking an action <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> from a
state <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and following a policy
<span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>. In other words, it
estimates the “value” of taking a particular action in a particular
state. Action-values are often referred to as <em>Q-values</em>, and the
value functions that output them are called <em>Q-functions</em>. One
way to approach an optimal policy in RL is by learning the
Q-function.</p>
<p><strong>Q-learning.</strong> Q-learning is one of the oldest and most
popular reinforcement learning algorithms. Q-learning approaches the RL
problem by estimating how good it is to take actions in each state.
Chess has numerous potential moves (actions) for each position on the
board (state). Q-learning would assign a score (Q-value) to each
state-action pair, indicating how beneficial each move is likely to be.
The goal is to determine the optimal Q-function—the rule that most
accurately assigns these scores—by mapping every state-action pair to
its optimal Q-value. When the environment has a finite number of states
and moves, the Q-function can be represented as a table, where each row
represents a state, and each column is an action.<br />
Therefore, Q-learning is the process of updating the Q-values of each
action iteratively based on the outcomes observed in the environment. At
each time step, the agent chooses the action with the highest associated
Q-value from those available to it in its current state. This generates
a new observation and reward, from which the agent updates its
estimates. Each table entry will converge to its optimal value through
many iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Q-learning in Gridworld.</strong> In Gridworld, we have four
actions (North, South, East, West) and 25 states (unique grid cells).
Therefore, the Q-function table would have 100 Q-values, one for every
state-action pair:<br />

</table>
</div>
<p>In the beginning, all the Q-value estimates are zero because the
agent has no information about the environment and will take random
actions. Eventually, the agent reaches a positive or negative reward
state. Say, for example, our agent gets lucky and finds its way to cell
(0,4) and chooses to go east. It will receive a reward of +1, and its
estimate of the Q-value for ((0,4), East) will be increased accordingly.
The agent learns that moving East is a good action to take in the state
(0,4), and it will be more likely to take this action the next time it
is in the same state.<br />
Over time, the negative and positive Q-values will propagate through the
table. The agent will repeat this process many times as it explores the
states in the environment and tries different actions, and if all goes
well, its estimates will converge to the optimal Q-function. By learning
which actions are desirable to take in which states, the agent learns
how to navigate the world successfully. As the environment becomes more
complicated and action space becomes larger, computing exact Q-values
becomes less computationally feasible. Instead, we might try to estimate
the Q-function using a less computationally taxing method. One such
method involves using neural networks to estimate the Q-function. This
is an example of a method known as deep RL.</p>

<p>Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is the area of machine learning
that leverages deep learning (DL) to help solve reinforcement learning
(RL) problems. Deep learning, which uses neural networks to compress and
extract information from vast amounts of data, can be applied to RL
problems such as sequential decision making. In this setting, the RL
setting provides signals to help neural networks learn useful
representations for the task at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning is a substantial part of nearly all major RL
successes in recent years.</strong> As the complexity of modeling even

accomplish interesting tasks demands powerful, scalable methods. Some of
the ways deep learning can be used in RL include:</p>

<li><p><strong>Value function.</strong> Deep neural networks such as
Deep Q-Network (DQN) can be used to estimate the Q-function. This is

state-action pairs. Instead of capturing the Q-function in a
state-action matrix, it can be directly encoded in a neural network,
which takes the state-action pair as an input and outputs the
action-value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we explore a few recent successes of deep RL.
Along the way, we’ll introduce a few more high-level techniques used to
solve common problems to conclude our discussion of RL.</p>
<h2 id="sec:examples-of-rl"> 2.5.6 Examples of RL</h2>
<h3 id="alphago">AlphaGo</h3>
<p>In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue made history by becoming the first AI to
defeat a world-class chess player. Yet it was not until nearly two
decades later that an AI managed to surpass humans in the game of Go,
when AlphaGo won against the best player in the world in 2017. Go is
similar to structure to chess, both being fully observable two-player
turn-based games, but Go is far more complicated. Unlike chess, with
only 20 possible first moves, Go starts with a staggering 361 choices.
This complexity outstrips the capabilities of the brute-force
computations that Deep Blue could rely on to evaluate positions.
Therefore, AlphaGo had to rely on the more sophisticated methods of deep
RL to master the game. By playing millions of games against itself,
AlphaGo honed its strategy and emerged as the world’s top Go player.</p>
<p><strong>RL agents can learn by competing against themselves.</strong>
One training method that has proven effective is <em>self-play</em>. In
part, this is because an RL model presents itself with an appropriate
opponent for an amateur: not a novice, who it could win against easily
without learning anything new, or a grandmaster, who would win against
it decisively enough that it might not understand how it could have
acted differently to prevent a loss. Instead, the best way for an
amateur to improve is to play against opponents of similar skill levels.
The insight of self-play is that a RL agent can learn from players of a
similar strength by playing against versions of itself. This allows the
agent to improve and reach a superhuman level of play without external
intervention.</p>
<h3 id="atari">Atari</h3>
<p>The Atari games are a collection of video games developed between the
1970s and 1980s for the Atari 2600 console, characterized by their
simple graphics, straightforward controls, and challenging gameplay.
Some of the most popular Atari games are Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and
Pong. Each game has its own unique set of rules, goals, and strategies.
As they provide a diverse set of challenges that an RL agent must learn
to overcome, Atari games have long served as a popular testing ground to
assess the capabilities of RL algorithms. They provide a platform to
evaluate how well RL agents can navigate complex environments and master
motor skills. In 2013, the DeepMind team proposed the original set of 57
Atari titles as an RL benchmark. Since then, RL agents have met or
surpassed human performance in every single one of these games <span
class="citation" data-cites="mnih2013playing"></span>. However, some
games took years longer to solve—and inspired new learning methods.</p>
<p><strong>Sparse rewards present challenges to learning.</strong> One
particularly difficult game for RL agents to solve is Montezuma’s
Revenge. In this game, players must make a long series of precise
movements to reach the first reward. They must navigate through a series
of mazes to collect treasure, including a key. The key is necessary to
advance to the next level. The challenge lies in the fact that an RL
agent that moves randomly at first is unlikely to ever encounter this
first reward, let alone complete a level. These rewards are rare and
hard to find. It also requires a delicate balance between exploration
and exploitation, as the key is often hidden in parts of the maze the
agent would not visit unless it is exploring, but exploring too much can
lead to running into traps or enemies. To reach any reward at all, the
player must perform a complex sequence of actions where a single mistake
can lead to losing a life. Learning this game through trial and error
can take a long time.<br />
Montezuma’s Revenge is a classic example of the problem of <em>sparse
rewards</em>, where the agent receives few signals to guide learning. In
environments like this, rewards are few and far between, depriving RL
agents of the feedback they need to learn effective strategies. In
contrast, a game like Breakout (in which a paddle at the bottom of the
environment is used to deflect a ball towards bricks to break them) is
much easier for RL agents. Even random movements are likely to deflect
the ball, break a block, and earn a reward reasonably quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Preferences for novelty can help overcome sparse
rewards.</strong> An RL agent which prefers <em>novelty</em> is rewarded
for new actions and observations. This method is how an RL agent
eventually solved Montezuma’s Revenge: it learned to find the first
reward simply by seeking out new observations. Imagine an RL agent
rewarded for novelty finds itself in an empty room with a single closed
door. After aimlessly wandering around the room for a while, the RL
agent will eventually “get bored” and figure out how to open the door,
venturing out of the room. In this way, novelty-seeking agents can
exhibit intelligent behavior without being explicitly rewarded for any
particular goal. There are many similar ways to develop RL agents and
promote optimal behavior.<br />
The exploration of Atari games and the development of novel methods to
tackle them have significantly advanced the field of reinforcement
learning, providing valuable insights into the learning process of RL
agents.</p>
<h3 id="starcraft">StarCraft</h3>
<p>In 2019, DeepMind’s RL system <em>AlphaStar</em> defeated an expert
human player 5-0 in a StarCraft II match <span class="citation"
data-cites="Vinyals2019"></span>. StarCraft II is a complicated
real-time strategy game that pits two players against each other in a
vast battlefield. StarCraft has many more possible actions and states
than chess, Go, or Atari games, making it a formidable challenge for
players and AIs alike.</p>
<p><strong>AlphaStar learned to overcome significant
uncertainty.</strong> The game’s difficulty is further amplified by its
partially observable environment, as most of the map is shrouded in a
fog of war, and players can only see areas where they have deployed
units. This means players must constantly act under uncertainty, making
educated guesses about the state of the environment and making
predictions about their opponent’s actions and strategies. AlphaStar’s
ability to overcome the challenges of uncertainty, a large action space,
and the need for strategic planning underscores the potential of RL in
navigating complicated, uncertain environments.</p>
<h3 id="diplomacy">Diplomacy</h3>
<p>In 2022, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) developed <em>Cicero</em>, a
program that reached human-level performance in the strategy game
Diplomacy <span class="citation" data-cites="Bakhtin2022"></span>. In
this game, players compete to take over a model of Europe against the
backdrop of the First World War. One of the central features of
Diplomacy is that players communicate in natural language to form
alliances and negotiate in between each turn. Cicero navigated not only
the game’s moves but also natural language processing and
generation.</p>
<p><strong>Cicero learned how to deceive.</strong> Cicero’s success
required learning how to deceive human players. It is documented to have
sometimes convinced other players to agree to lopsided deals or break
promises when it was advantageous. In other words, Cicero developed a
capacity for deception. This result is not surprising: success in
Diplomacy often requires deception.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This section explores the major concepts, terms, and techniques
involved in reinforcement learning. First, we used two simple
examples—Multi-Armed Bandits and Gridworld—to outline the major concepts
and terms used in RL. At each time step, the agent takes some action
drawn from the action space, which affects the state of the environment.
Then, the agent receives a reward signal and a state observation from
the environment. The agent acts according to its policy, which specifies
an action for every possible state observation. The agent’s value
function computes the expected cumulative reward of a certain state
(state-value) or state-action pair (Q-value) given a certain policy.
Q-values can be used for Q-learning, one popular learning algorithm, to
update an agent’s policy toward an optimal policy.<br />
After outlining the major concepts and terms used in RL, we discussed
some powerful techniques used in groundbreaking RL systems. First, deep
RL uses deep learning to estimate value functions and policies in tasks
that are too complex to allow exact computation. Second, self-play
expands the ability of RL systems in competitive tasks by repeatedly
pitting the system against itself. Finally, RL systems can overcome the
problem of sparse rewards through preferences for novelty.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-3"> 2.6 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Understanding the technical underpinnings of AI systems—the
underlying models and algorithms, how they work, how they are used, and
how they are evaluated—is essential to understanding the safety, ethics,
and societal impact of these technologies. This foundation equips us
with the necessary grounding and context to identify and critically
analyze their capabilities and potential, as well as the risks that they
pose. It allows us to discern potential pitfalls in their design,
implementation, and deployment and devise strategies to ensure their
safe, ethical, and beneficial use.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we presented the fundamentals of artificial
intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), which aims to
create systems that can learn without being explicitly instructed. We
examined its foundational principles, methodologies, and evolution,
detailing key techniques, concepts, and practical applications.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence.</strong> We first discussed AI, the
vast umbrella that encapsulates the idea of machines performing tasks
typically associated with human intelligence. AI and its conceptual
origins date back to the 1940s and 1950s when the project of creating
“intelligent machines” came to the fore. The field experienced periods
of flux over the following decades, waxing and waning until the modern
deep learning era was ushered in by the groundbreaking release of
AlexNet in 2012, driven by increased data availability and advances in
hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Defining AI.</strong> The term “artificial intelligence” has
many meanings, and the capabilities of AI systems exist on a continuum.
Five widely used conceptual categories to distinguish between different
types of AI are narrow AI, artificial general intelligence (AGI),
human-level AI (HLAI), transformative AI (TAI), and artificial
superintelligence (ASI). While these concepts provide a basis for
thinking about the intelligence and generality of AI systems, they are
not well-defined or complete, often overlapping and used in different,
conflicting ways. Therefore, in evaluating risk, it is essential to
consider AI systems based on their specific capabilities instead of
broad categorizations.</p>
<p><strong>The ML process.</strong> We presented a general framework for
understanding ML models by considering five aspects of a model: its
task, input data, output, and what type of machine learning it uses. We
then discussed each of these aspects in turn. We explored common tasks
for ML models, including classification, regression, anomaly detection,
and sequence modeling. We highlighted a few of the many types of data
that these models work with and discussed the model development process.
Creating an ML model is a multi-step process that typically includes
data collection, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
Measuring the performance of a model in evaluation is a critical step in
the development process. We surveyed several metrics used to achieve
this, as well as the broader, often conflicting goals that guide this
process.</p>
<p><strong>Types of ML.</strong> We discussed different approaches to
machine learning and how these categories are neither well-defined nor
complete, even though distinctions are often drawn between different
“types” of machine learning. We surveyed four common approaches to ML:
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
deep learning. At a high level, supervised learning is learning from
labeled data, unsupervised learning is learning from unlabeled data, and
reinforcement learning is learning from agent-gathered data. Deep
learning techniques are used in all three settings, leveraging deep
neural networks to achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning.</strong> We then examined deep learning in
more depth. We saw how, beyond its use of multi-layer neural networks,
deep learning is characterized by its ability to learn hierarchical
representations that provide deep learning models with great flexibility
and power. Machine learning models are functions that capture
relationships between inputs and outputs with representations that allow
them to capture an especially broad family of relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Components of DL models.</strong> We explored the essential
components of deep learning models and neural networks. Through the
example of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), we broke down neural
networks, structures composed of layers of neurons, into an input layer,
an output layer, one or more hidden layers, weights, biases, and
activation functions. We highlighted a few significant activation
functions and examined other fundamental building blocks of deep
learning models, including residual connections, convolution, and
self-attention. We also presented influential architectures, such as
CNNs and Transformers.</p>
<p><strong>Processes in DL models.</strong> We discussed how deep
learning models learn and are used in training and inference. We walked
through the steps to training a deep learning model, beginning with
initialization and then cycling through sending information forward to
make a prediction, measuring its error or quality, sending this error
backward, and adjusting parameters accordingly until a stopping
criterion is reached. We discussed training techniques such as
pre-training, fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot learning,
and how training typically involves a combination of many methods and
techniques used in conjunction. We considered the importance of
scalability, computational efficiency, and interpretability in
evaluating deep learning models and their suitability for deployment. We
plotted the course of technical and architectural development in the
field, from LeNet in 1989 to BERT and GPT models in 2018. We considered
real-world applications of deep learning in communication and
entertainment, transportation and logistics, and healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling laws.</strong> Scaling laws describe mathematical
relationships between model performance and key factors like model size
and dataset size in deep learning. These power law equations show that
as models grow in parameters and are trained on more data, their loss
tends to decrease substantially, though not linearly. Scaling up
computational resources used to train a model can enable an increase in
both model parameters and the amount of data used in training.
Researchers can leverage scaling laws to determine optimal model and
dataset sizes given computational constraints. for example, the
Chinchilla model from Google DeepMind demonstrates that smaller models
can outperform larger ones if given much more training data. Scaling
laws hold across many modalities and orders of magnitude. However, these
laws only appear to apply to certain types of model such as generative
models.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning.</strong> Finally, we turned our
attention to reinforcement learning and explored the field’s basic
concepts, terminology, and techniques. We examined RL problems, which
provide the general framework through which reinforcement learning
attempts to automate the capacity of an agent to learn from its actions
and their consequences in an environment. In these problems, agents
learn to make decisions through trial and error. Through the toy
examples of multi-armed bandits and Gridworld, we introduced the major
concepts and terms used in reinforcement learning. Lastly, we saw a few
examples of groundbreaking applications of RL in gaming, including
AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and Cicero.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>AI created fundamental changes, offering benefits and
presenting risks.</strong> AI is increasingly being integrated into
business, education, healthcare, communication, and other aspects of our
lives. As its influence grows, so too does its potential for harm. AI
systems and their use, whether to automate intricate processes in
manufacturing or to personalize experiences in retail and entertainment,
have direct, real-world impacts. Moreover, AI introduces unique risks,
as it involves the creation of systems that have the ability to learn
and pursue objectives. While highly advanced or general AI systems often
garner the most attention, AI can pose risks at any level of capability.
Even a narrowly-designed model in a critical infrastructure system could
cause significant damage or disruption if it malfunctions or is
exploited. Therefore, it is essential to consider the risks and impact
of AI across multiple scales: immediate <em>and</em> long-term,
individual <em>and</em> societal.</p>
<p><strong>Predicting the trajectory and impact of AI is a difficult and
uncertain task.</strong> We have already seen AI systems that achieved
better-than-human performance in specific, narrow tasks such as image
recognition or playing chess. As technological advancement continues, it
is possible that we may see more general, advanced, and transformative
systems that can perform a wider array of tasks and adapt to more
complex scenarios. However, forecasting these developments involves a
high degree of uncertainty, both in terms of rate and direction of AI
advancement and in the potential risks and capabilities of individual
systems. The progression of AI is not linear and is influenced by a
multitude of factors, including advancements in algorithms, hardware,
data availability, policy regulations, and economic conditions. Hence, a
prudent approach to AI development involves continuous vigilance,
rigorous testing, and adaptable strategies to manage both expected and
unanticipated challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning has emerged as a potent and defining force in
AI, driving significant advancements and innovations.</strong> The
strength of deep learning models lies in their ability to learn and
generalize from extensive datasets. Deep learning models can process
massive quantities of information, discerning patterns and relationships
that are too complex for traditional algorithms. These powerful
capabilities are integral to many tools and systems we encounter in our
daily lives. Deep learning is the engine behind systems that recognize
patterns in images and speech, enabling technologies like automatic
photo tagging and voice-activated virtual assistants. It powers
autonomous vehicles, chatbots, predictive modeling tools, and
translation applications. The scope of deep learning’s influence is vast
and continues to expand, underscoring its pivotal role in the future of
AI.<br />
Despite their accomplishments, DL and ML systems have many flaws and
limitations. Their performance and capabilities depend on a number of
factors, including the quality and quantity of training data, the
algorithms and architectures used, and the amount of computational power
available. In addition, these systems often struggle to generalize
beyond the specific contexts they were trained in. They lack the common
sense and contextual knowledge that humans often use to make decisions,
leading to errors that may seem obvious to human observers. Moreover,
they often act as <em>black boxes</em> where the internal mechanisms
driving their predictions are <em>opaque</em>, a trait that can be
especially problematic in high-stakes settings.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding ML models is essential to identifying risks
associated with their use.</strong> Deep learning models are prone to
absorbing and replicating biased patterns embedded in their training
data, leading to skewed and possibly discriminatory decisions. Equipped
with this knowledge, we can anticipate such issues and proactively
implement measures to address them, creating more equitable outcomes.
Moreover, an informed understanding of the technical intricacies of AI
systems is instrumental to assessing and incorporating crucial factors
like robustness and interpretability in their development and
deployment. In doing so, we are better able to do things like improve
model performance in various environments and against adversarial
attacks and provide more transparency and accountability. Consequently,
understanding ML models is key to ensuring the responsible and equitable
use of these powerful tools.</p>
<p><strong>The methodologies employed to train models determine the
capabilities and impact of these systems.</strong> Many techniques
exist, each with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and associated safety
or ethical considerations. A system trained with reinforcement learning
might adopt risky or harmful behaviors if these behaviors are
accidentally rewarded during training. This can pose considerable risks,
especially in real-world, high-stakes environments. Similarly, a model
trained using few-shot learning techniques, which rely on learning from
a minimal number of examples, might make crucial decisions based on an
insufficient amount of data. This can introduce inaccuracies,
potentially causing harm or undesired outcomes. Therefore, understanding
the intricacies of different training methods and techniques is vital to
developing robust and ethical AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>AI is poised to become increasingly capable and influential
as technology progresses.</strong> Some of recent AI growth is driven by
advancements in algorithms and techniques, which enable systems to learn
and make predictions more accurately and efficiently as they increase in
sophistication. Concurrently, the development of more powerful and
cost-effective computing technology is facilitating the deployment and
scaling of AI systems, making them more accessible, widespread, and
capable. Moreover, the expanding volume and variety of data available
for training is significantly enhancing their ability to learn and
generalize, thereby broadening their applicability. Together, these
factors—techniques, compute, and data—are accelerating the advancement
of AI systems. AI’s impact on individuals, industries, and society in
the future is only becoming more profound.</p>
